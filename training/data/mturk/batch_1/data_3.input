Sure it's been done before, many times, but the Hyper Light Drifter Collector's Edition looks pretty sweet. It comes with a cyan ""SNES cartridge,"" a 24-page manual, a 24-inch by 18-inch world map poster, a box to store it all in and a digital code for the game. That manual is particularly welcome; a full-color booklet with information on enemies, drifters, and tons of beautiful artwork. The SNES cartridge is in quotes because it's just a non-functional piece of art. Also it's a North American-style SNES cartridge, so if you owned a European or Asian console, it won't look very familiar to you. As for the game... Hyper Light Drifter is really good. A lot of people have compared it to Dark Souls, but it's only similar in that it's difficult. It's a top-down 2D action game, with a mysterious but gentle storyline and some very tough combat. When you die -- and you'll do so a lot -- though, you just get transported to the beginning of the combat area with no punishment. In that way, it's got the ""live, die repeat"" mechanics of other indie games like Hotline Miami. Pre-orders for the Collector's Edition start today in PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One flavors, all priced at $65. If you order the PC version, you'll get a Steam code immediately, and the cool collector-y stuff late this summer. As the Xbox and PS4 versions aren't due out until summer, you'll get your code as soon as it's available. iam8bit, the store selling the special edition, says its goal is ""to have the boxes shipped out in concert with Hyper Light Drifter's console release."" In addition to the Collector's Edition, iam8bit is also selling a 4LP vinyl soundtrack and some fine art prints from the game."

If you think it's worth over six digits, Israeli start-up Sirin Labs just announced a smartphone for you. The Solarin costs PS9,500. After tax and conversion, that's roughly $16,500 or AU$22,700. The selling point of the phone is its KoolSpan military-grade encryption and Zimperium-based threat detection. ""Our core consumers are international business travellers that spend much of their lives on the move,"" company co-founder and CEO Tal Cohen said at the product's launch, according to CNN. He later warned that hacking ""is something that can happen to any one of us...it's just a question of if you're targeted or not."" The Solarin houses a 5.5-inch LED display with a 2K 2,048x1,080-pixel resolution screen. On the back is a 23.8-megapixel camera, and its sound system boasts three bass-boosted speakers. The phone is also said to be the first to use WiGig technology, which allows for speeds of up to 4.6Gbps. That all sounds impressive. But, then again, $16,500..."

Endemol Shine Studios acquired the TV rights to Mirror's Edge and is working with EA to transform it into a female-centric action series (much like the game itself). Deadline originally reported the deal and EA confirmed its existence to Engadget. ""We are excited to be working with Endemol Shine Studios to explore a potential Mirror's Edge project for television,"" an EA spokesperson said. The original Mirror's Edge hit the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008. It's a rapid-fire first-person game starring Faith, a freerunner, as she battles a dystopian government across a sleek, futuristic city. It was heralded for innovative gameplay mechanics yet criticized for not presenting a deep enough story to satisfy many couch-bound freerunners. Its long-awaited sequel, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, is due to land on Xbox One and PS4 on June 7th, and it promises to showcase a larger storyline and bigger city to explore. Endemol Shine Studios is the scripted division of Endemol Shine North America, meaning any Mirror's Edge TV show won't be a reality series (although, watching Faith freerun around the Big Brother house would be infinitely amusing). ""We clearly see Mirror's Edge as a franchise for the global TV audience,"" Endemol Shine Studios president Sharon Hall said, according to Deadline. ""It has a strong female protagonist, a wildly rabid fan base and a worldwide brand that Electronic Arts and EA DICE have done an amazing job establishing."""

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Notes read full article at http://www.effectiveecommerce.com/ecommerce-news-ep-2-spotlight-marketing-and-google-adwords-pla-updates/ E-commerce is the new trend that has taken the world by storm. Why spend loads of money to own an outlet and be limited to just a few consumers, when you can have your business on the internet and get millions of people to visit your online store every single day. About Us Effective E-commerce with Travis Marziani is an online broadcast for E-commerce operators and individuals looking to get into the business. In these short clip, a lot about E-commerce is addressed leaving you with loads of information that you would need to thrive in your business. The world of e-commerce can be quite daunting, if you step into it blindly without proper knowledge of what to do. These videos provide a number of helpful tips that would be of immense value to you and your business. Get where you want to be in as little time as possible! This episode of E-commerce News takes a look at how over 30,000 target consumers were drawn to an E-commerce site at no costs at all. Also, we take a look at how Ad-words and product listing ads can help to generate traffic from your target demographic. There are a number of ways to get exactly where you want to be in your business. These include: Spotlight marketing Spotlight marketing is a very important concept in E-commerce, and was used to get over 30,000 people to a website. Like most online business operators, when your business begins, you may be looking for a cheap way to get people to visit your website. Most of the techniques that E-commerce authors and advisers may preach would often require sizeable investments. One of the best ways to reach out to your target demographic is by first of all providing value to your customers. The hard truth is, if your product is not solving a dire need of consumers, very few people would even take a look at your business or want to partner with you. You may think that the best way to publicize your business is by publicizing the people you want to partner with and them to help you out in publicizing your business also. This may not work, as most people would relent at the thought of helping someone that is not known. The thought process then leads back to 'what exactly can you give that would be of value to your partners""? You need to get your ultimate true fans to give their honest opinion about how your product helps out. This is often known as your 'true-thousand' fans. Starting an E-commerce company that sells dance clothing required me providing a service of dance studios. This however required me getting the help of dance studios in the area and getting them to partner with me via their websites. The dance studios were reluctant to participate because most of them do not require your services because you are unknown. You need to rank for certain keywords that have the potential to place your business in the spotlight. A list was compiled and then customers that patronized dance clothing shared their opinions, which then reflected on the top dance studios around. This greatly warmed them up to want to do business with the brand. The dance studios then highlighted the brand and it got a lot of consumers to come on to the E-commerce website. Ad-words This is another great way to get a reasonable amount of traffic to your site. It is very important to make use of final URLs instead of destination URLs. Google has recently revamped their system for Ad-word searching and this helps to transfer customers directly to your brand."

Set fifteen years in the future, it's now commonplace for people to equip themselves with artificial limbs. But after the so-called ""aug incident,"" where augmented humans are covertly hacked and forced to turn violent, society is split down the middle -- both ethically and physically. Augmented and non-augmented individuals are forced to live separately, fuelling civil unrest. It's a gripping backdrop for a video game, and one you can now absorb through a new live-action trailer. Live-action video game trailers are normally a bit rubbish, but this one is surprisingly effective. You get a good sense of how the technology has developed, why so many people have embraced it, and a hint of the ""madness"" that gripped people during the pivotal ""aug incident."" Whether you're a longtime Deus Ex fan or a franchise beginner, it's enough to give you the gist of hero Adam Jensen's situation. An augmented individual himself, he works both for Interpol and a hacker group in order to find ""Illuminati,"" the people responsible for the lethal malfunctions. The game is set to land on August 23rd."

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f3a751ac842181db70a1"	"APPLE - Why is the Iphone 6 no longer a first-class smartphone?"

Lenovo unveiled the Phab2 Pro, the first flagship Project Tango smartphone, on Thursday at the company's Tech World event in San Francisco. The unveiling comes more than two years after Google first introduced Project Tango, its (at the time) experimental effort to bring computer vision and 3D-sensing abilities to smartphones and tablets. SEE ALSO: Google Daydream and Project Tango: We've gotta get these guys together In addition to the typical cameras and sensors that power most smartphones, Tango devices are equipped with motion and depth sensors, along with computer vision software, to create augmented-reality experiences that wouldn't be otherwise be possible on a smartphone. The Phab2 Pro is massive, weighing more than half a pound. These extra components (and the types of experiences they create) help account for the Phab2 Pro's massive size -- and it is massive. Its Quad HD display clocks in at a plus-size 6.4 inches, and it weighs more than half a pound. ""It was a tough engineering feat,"" Lenovo's VP of Android Jeff Meredith tells Mashable.""You need a relatively large screen to be able to fully take advantage and enjoy the experience of what Tango offers... we felt that 6.4 was the right selection for us at this stage."" Display aside, the handset is also equipped with a 4K-ready 16MP camera, 4GB of RAM and dual SIM slots all powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. It comes in two color variants: champagne gold and gunmetal gray and comes with 64GB of storage, along with a microSD slot. Lenovo's Phab2 Pro. Image: Lenovo Those would be more than respectable specs by most Android flagship standards but more impressive may be the price: The Phab2 Pro will cost just $499 when it goes on sale in August. For those who want to spend a little less, Lenovo is also introducing two other Tango-enabled handsets, the $199 Phab2 and $299 Phab2 Plus.  The $199 Phab2 also has a 6.4-inch HD display and is equipped with a 13MP camera. The $299 Phab2 Plus, on the other hand, is being positioned as a midrange device that doesn't skimp on the camera. The device, also 6.4-inches, has two 13MP rear-facing cameras with f/2.0 lenses. The cameras are powered by the same image processor inside of a Leica camera, Lenovo says. Of course, extra cameras, 3D-sensing, and advanced computer vision are only as good as the apps that can actually take advantage of them. There are already more than 100 Tango-ready apps in Google Play, including several augmented reality games. Gaming, says Meredith, will likely be one of the biggest use cases for Project Tango since it marks the first time gamers can get a true augmented-reality experience on a smartphone. But AR is good for more than just games: Lenovo also showed off an app from Google called Measure, which allows people to measure the dimensions of the spaces around them just by pointing the device at the area. Lowe's, one of the first retailers that will sell the Phab2 Pro, also has an app that allows users to see visualizations of how new appliances and other items will look in their houses before they buy them. The Phab2Pro will go on sale in August for $399, the $299 Phab2 Plus and $199 Phab2 will both be available in September.  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."
