Following a less-than-successful initial test run, NASA and Bigelow Aerospace have successfully inflated the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module attached to the International Space Station. It took several hours (the team didn't want any movement that could destabilize the station), but the experimental pod now extends nearly 5.6 feet out and 10.6 feet across. That's not the full size (it'll ultimately be 7 feet long), but it's hopefully smooth sailing from here on out. You'll have to wait a while before anyone steps inside this cocoon-like pod, mind you. The next objective is to pressurize the habitat, and it'll be roughly a week before the ISS crew gets to try it out. Still, this is a big step toward more livable spacecraft that use inflatable habitats to offer some much-needed breathing room.

Spain. These graphene polymer cells give the car a range of 1,000 kilometers These batteries triple the power of lithium ion and reduce its price by 77%. If there is something to lose sleep electric vehicle manufacturers are batteries. It is a requirement of the sector to increase its potency and duration as well as reduce load time Headaches that are about to come to an end. The production of graphene on an industrial scale, has joined the University of Cordoba for the first graphene polymer batteries. A company will be responsible for the manufacture of the cells, which have already been tested in Cordoba, starting next year. Two of the four major German automotive companies (can not yet reveal names) will begin this month to test the batteries with electric cars. Graphene, discovered in 2004 by Dr. Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester, has amazing properties. It is thin, superconducting, transparent and strong. Although it takes years promising to revolutionize the field of batteries, it was difficult to incorporate it into mass production. However, in 2012 the company, in Alicante, became the first global manufacturer of graphene on an industrial scale. From there the main effort has been focused on accelerating the actual applications called 'material god'. The latter comes as a battery. The newly developed technology incorporates graphene polymer composition. The benefits result in energy density, length, speed of load, weight and price. ""It will be a great leap forward for industries such as aerospace, automotive, computer or power supply, improving efficiency and providing opportunities that until now, could only be imagined. The new product, developed by the University of Cordoba, has a power ""far superior"" to any other technology available in the market, a fact that ""minimizes the percentage of wasted energy during use."" If lithium ion battery (the most advanced to date) has a density of 180 of graphene exceeds 600. That is, three times the power of current best technology on the market. Also gains in lifetime. Graphenano batteries are able to last up to four times longer than traditional metal hydride and two times more than lithium. For example, ""an electric vehicle with this technology could reach 1,000 km of autonomy."" And all this with a load of no more than eight minutes. Less weight and cost properties of graphene may also reduce the weight of the batteries 'half' of the conventional, ""increasing the performance and autonomy of the machines on which it is applied."" The University of Cordoba is now working to reduce the volume to an advanced version of the batteries. Graphene has ""high density"", so for now the batteries are suitable for electric vehicles (from boats to cars). In the future, the team hopes to reduce its size to incorporate into electronic devices such as mobile phones. Cost is another advantage of graphene batteries, which will manufacture and market. This product will be ""up to 77% cheaper"" than lithium, ""standing within reach of consumers from the same day they go on sale."" They will be compatible with existing devices or vehicles, avoiding an adaptation of infrastructure for use and promoting its rapid implementation. Today ""Grabat Energy"" and ""Graphenano batteries"" will be a reality."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uueLj9zXuic/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/uueLj9zXuic"

The fight between different standards and a lack of support from phone makers has made the entire idea of charging your mobile wirelessly a huge mess. Mophie is hoping to bring some sanity to the concept with its new $100 Juice Pack Wireless cases for the iPhone 6 and 6S, which integrate cord-free charging along with an additional 50 percent of battery life. Like Mophie's earlier wireless cases for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, the new iPhone cases are compatible with virtually every wireless charging standard on the market, including Qi and Powermat. They also sport integrated magnets, which keeps them attached to their included charging bases, as well as Mophie's vent mount for cars and desk mount accessories. Naturally, those mounts also serve as wireless charging surfaces. By adding in magnets, Mophie solves a problem endemic to all wireless charging solutions so far: they're often less convenient than charging with a cord, since you can't pick up your phone. Mophie's mount accessories avoids that issue entirely. More so than Samsung's recent phones, which already have wireless charging integrated, the Juice Pack Wireless cases are a boon for iPhone users who have been aching for cord-free charging. iPhone owners already need special cases if they want to take advantage of wireless charging -- Mophie's cases simply gives them the benefit of a portable battery pack as well. Mophie plans to make wireless charging a standard feature in all of its cases moving forward, which could make its products more compelling to people who aren't just interested in extra battery life. And that might just give the cordless charging market the kick in the pants it needs."

During a livestream event, Bungie confirmed that, as rumored, Rise of Iron will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. All of the game's previous expansions were released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well. Rise of Iron launches on September 20, priced at $30. However, it does also require the Destiny base game, as well as The Dark Below, House of Wolves, and The Taken King. ""Rise of Iron is an exciting addition to the Destiny universe,"" Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said in a statement. ""We are continually blown away and inspired by the growing Destiny community's energy and enthusiasm."" The expansion includes new areas, including The Plaguelands and Felwinter Peak. Additionally, the Destiny starting area, The Wall, has been recreated as a new area you can revisit. Players will also find a new raid, new and updated strikes, and more patrols and public events. Multiplayer fans may be happy to learn, too, that there will be more Crucible maps and features, while Rise of Iron also adds new CG and in-game cinematics. Additionally, Rise of Iron comes with a new Light level increase (an unspecified ""significant Light increase,"" developers said) and a new ""mutated"" enemy faction of the Fallen. One of the new weapons is a ""flaming waraxe,"" which is an ""encounter-specific weapon,"" developers said. This suggests it may not be available in Crucible matches. Here is what it looks like. Activision In terms of story, here is the official description: ""Guardians must rise to the challenge to take their place as the next generation of Iron Lords. Along the way they will join forces with a legend from humanity's Golden Age to defeat a plague of unstoppable evil once and for all."" Also during the livestream event, Bungie confirmed that the fan-favorite Gjallarhorn weapon is returning for Rise of Iron. Everyone can get it by completing a mission, while people who preorder will receive a limited-edition black and silver version of the gun. Similar to past Destiny expansions, there will also be items exclusive to PlayStation players for a period of time. Bungie did not announce this content today, but said more details on this, and other things related to Rise of Iron, are coming ""at a later date."" At the end of the livestream today, Bungie teased that more details may be shared at E3 2016 next week. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Rise of Iron. Looking ahead, Bungie will release a Destiny sequel in 2017; according to a report, the game was recently rebooted."

""Our ambition is to enable robotic computing for every household,"" he said before revealing ZenBo the home robot. With the goals of ""assistance, entertainment and companionship,"" it's particularly aimed at older people. However, the most interesting feature here is the promise that the robot will connect with traditional and smart home devices: you'll be able to check who's at the door from a connected camera, and then remote-unlock the door from the robot's, er, face. Zenbo will be able to connect to lights, TVs, air conditioners -- if it talks the right languages. Gallery: ASUS Zenbo home robot announcement | 24 Photos 24 +20  The robot can roam around independently, and take directions by voice command. ZenBo's face also acts as a touchpad interface: you'll be able to place video calls, shop online, as well as stream video content, when it's not blushing. It's still early days, but ASUS says ZenBo will offer spoken reminders to its owners, like doctor appointment and medication cues. It'll also be able to send emergency messages to family members if someone falls down -- you can even take control of the robot and check the situation from ZenBo's built in camera. For kids, the robot will be able to (awkwardly, robotically) dance along to music as well as read stories aloud from its built-in library. Naturally, ASUS is promoting a Zenbo developer program, with access to the bot's SDK and more information to help birth apps -- something very important if the robot is to be a success. It will be inevitably compared to Softbank's Pepper home robot, and there's a few similarities, but if it can learn one major lesson from its taller Japanese rival, it's that it needs a reason to exist, a reason to buy. It could be those smart home tricks that make or break Zenbo. Although that $599 price tag is pretty cheap for a home robot -- that will certainly help."

That's not to say the game itself isn't any good -- in fact, it's a wonderful single- and multiplayer experience for the fantastical first-person-shooter crowd. However, the opening video is divine. It's evocative, rich and effortlessly cool, built on a base of smooth hip hop and anime-inspired, neon-coated illustrations. When I think of Battleborn, my mind is immediately saturated in the cinematic's soulful rhythm. This is a new brand of video game artistry. As a game, Battleborn doesn't feature cartoon characters; it's a fully realized 3D experience from Gearbox, the creators of Borderlands. In the same vein as Borderlands, Battleborn is highly stylized, but it looks nothing like the opening cinematic. That was on purpose. Gallery: Making the 'Battleborn' cinematic | 25 Photos 25 +21  ""I wanted to come with something fresh in a sea of CG cinematics and openers,"" Gearbox art director Scott Kester says. ""We just figured players would appreciate something a bit different. I wanted a vibe to it that was fresh, but also kind of piggybacked off the feel of Samurai Champloo's opening, with a healthy mix of Aeon Flux for good measure."" Kester was inspired by cartoons from the '80s and early '90s, and he wanted the prologue to get players pumped for the actual game. He secured the cinematic of his dreams by working with animation studio Secret Sauce and hip hop group Deltron 3030, which includes Dan the Automator (Daniel Nakamura) and Del The Funky Homosapien (Teren Jones). The cinematic's energetic animations and its mellow soundtrack balance each other perfectly; they feel as if they were produced by the same mind. In reality, they were completely separate projects. Secret Sauce CEO Sanford Greene and animation director LD Walker didn't even hear the song until their work on the animation was finished, Greene says. ""During the production of the animation we didn't have any soundtrack to go by so LD did his best to keep the shot pacing tight in the middle and open on the ends,"" he says. ""Seems it just magically worked out after Del's track was recorded and laid down."" As he wrote the lyrics for ""Countdown,"" the prologue song, Del took inspiration from Battleborn's storyline, interpreting its main points in his own way. He didn't want the track to feel like an advertisement for the game. ""I just took the subject matter of the game and I went with that, but without directly following it note for note,"" Del says. ""Tried to make it more universal in feel so it could stand outside of the game as well."" One reason these pieces came together so seamlessly was the creators' shared love of video games. Walker in particular is a fan of action role-playing titles, platformers, fighters and shoot-em-ups. Del is a huge gaming fan and he's been making music for the industry since 2000. His work has appeared in Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, a handful of Tony Hawk titles, NBA 2K5 and 2K7, Skate 3, and, more recently, Street Fighter V. ""I was a crazy player when it was the vidiot era -- '80s, you know, arcades and stuff,"" Del says. ""I used to be stuck at the arcade, I used to buy every mag.... I had every system, still have emulators of most of the classic systems with every game, I got every arcade emu for every game I ever played in the arcade -- so, uh, yeah, I'm kinda a video game fan, a little."" It also helped that Secret Sauce and Gearbox go way back. Sanford and Kester have known each other for a long time; they actually started out working together in the comics industry. Secret Sauce is a small and relatively new team, but Kester says he respects their work. Plus, working with Deltron 3030 was ""a dream"" of Kester's, partially because he's a fan of Dan the Automator and Del, and partially because this project gave him a chance to amplify their voices. Sure, Del has created music for video games, but that doesn't mean he's a household name in the gaming universe. ""Del tells such vivid sci-fi stories in his lyrics and was just a perfect fit for us,"" Kester says. ""I was specifically interested in Deltron and Secret Sauce due to the fact they aren't super widely known in the game community. I think any time you can draw more attention to different artists across different disciplines is, well, like a duty we have as creators, honestly. To expose people to new cool things."" Secret Sauce was definitely on-board with Kester's preferred animation style, too: a Japanese-inspired, anime look. ""They avoid correcting every single drawing to look perfectly homogeneous,"" Walker says. ""Instead, they let that animator cut loose and belt out the equivalent of a guitar solo."" That's what Kester wanted with the Battleborn introduction video; something raw yet intriguing to long-time FPS fans. Something different. The AAA industry is largely focused on creating realistic 3D animations, Kester notes, and he hopes the cinematic is part of video games' growth as an artistic medium. He'd love to play an entire game that looks like the prologue, for instance. ""I'm interested in seeing game art styles evolve and take us to new places visually,"" Kester says. ""We have an obsession in the gaming world to keep trying to replicate reality, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm more interested personally in making things that let me escape this world. Let's show people styles and places I could never visit in real life."" Video games are art and experiences like the Battleborn prologue help demonstrate this aspect to the wider world. Del, for his part, has always viewed games as artistic expressions. ""Maybe people just didn't believe or see it, but I did,"" Del says. ""Matter of fact, the earlier games had to have art invested in it because the graphics weren't that great."" Today, the potential for wild artistic experimentation exists within gaming, Del says, but large studios are mostly focused on creating lifelike worlds. ""I lean toward more fanciful-type games, personally,"" he says. Now that Secret Sauce has dipped its toes into the world of gaming animation, Walker and Greene are hungry for more -- and they're not just dreaming any longer. Or, as Greene puts it: ""We have plans. Let's just say that."""

BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision.

The game is currently scheduled for release on both consoles and PC some point in 2017. It follows the standard RPG trope format wherein a player's neophyte character joins an organization -- in this case, the ""Absolvers"" who maintain world stability through combat -- and must advance through the ranks by clearing dungeons. You know, just like your first job out of school. The game will include both PvE and PvP arenas and offer all sorts of upgradeable/customizable gear. Everything from armor and weapons to combat styles and even individual attack sequences can be tweaked to the player's preference -- fingers crossed for a One Punch Man skin. But what really sets Absolver apart from other MMOs is its utter lack of firearms. From what you can see in the reveal trailer above, characters will have access to swords, staves and maybe even some magic but projectile weapons appear strictly verboten. Also looks like players will be able to assemble themselves into mobs for large-scale PvP rioting. We'll get a better look at the action at E3 where Devolver Digital will host hands-on demos."

While we in Android-land likely smirked and counted ourselves lucky, the first three smartphones with no headphone port have just been announced in China. And they run Android. LeEco, formerly LeTV, today revealed the new Le 2 range, including the Le 2, Le 2Pro and Le Max2, none of which sport the familiar 3.5mm headphone port we've been using since we first started attaching headphones to smartphones. Instead, these phones all support USB Type-C digital headphones through the charging port. This means that we will have better audio quality thanks to the lossless nature of digital headphones, but it also means you'll lose the ability to listen to music when charging your phone, something many of us us do at work every single day. So while it might be nice to have fancy new USB Type-C headphones, you might also need to invest in a solid pair of Bluetooth headphones. Until the launch of LeEco's two new pairs of USB Type-C headphones - an in-ear variety and over-ear set - the JBL Reflect Aware C sports earbuds announced alongside the HTC 10 were the only USB Type-C headphones around So not only has Android become the first platform to release a device with no 3.5mm headphone port, it may be a trend that is catching on."

The JumpRoACH is a simple, two-ounce device with six crawling feet and a diamond-shaped jumping/launching mechanism powered by eight stretchy latex bands and small DC motor. While the usefulness of a robotic insect is debatable, it is definitely staying true to its source material. the major robotics breakthrough here is the robo-roach's ability to actually control the power of its tiny catapult mechanism and time its launch so it makes the jump. While the JumpRoACH (thankfully) can't fly just yet, it does have wings it can open to flip itself over onto its feet and keep on marching into your nightmares. Observe: While this is not the first robotic cockroach designed at UC Berkeley, we can all be thankful that we're not dealing with an army of actual robot zombie cockroaches."
