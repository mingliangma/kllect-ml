They deserve far more credit than they're getting, but there's no denying that they've never fully escaped deep nerd territory. That, our friends, is what you call a branding problem. And from the looks of it, X-Men: Apocalypse hasn't solved it. Coming in at $80 million domestically (modest for a holiday weekend, especially compared to Days of Future Past's $110.5 million opening weekend), it's no juggernaut. Sure, it took the top spot, but its competition was the unasked-for and the ridiculous: Alice Through the Looking Glass and Angry Birds. So, as we've done before with other blockbusters, we dug around the Internet to track the successes and failures of Apocalypse's marketing campaign. It's got all the right moves--nostalgia, ""accessible"" stars, app-based stunts--but it falls a little short of having that spark. And once the box-office projections came in, things got a little...awkward. Going Retro Admittedly, things start out kinda sweet. Apocalypse's '80s vibes have been fun from the beginning, and the marketing campaign has embraced and made the most of that throwback nostalgia. To wit: this kitschy, lo-res fake commercial for Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, starring Jubilee (Lana Condor): Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is now open for enrollment! #XMenApocalypsehttps://t.co/B3KSNPz05A -- X-Men Movies (@XMenMovies) May 19, 2016 Or this fake ad for an episode of In the Footsteps of ... (a parody of Leonard Nimoy's old mystery show, In Search Of ...) about En Sabah Nur (Apocalypse). (Which they followed up with a series of tweets linking Apocalypse to major historical disasters.)

Getting with the Kids But you know who doesn't get nostalgic about the '80s? People who weren't alive in the '80s. So while it escapes that Batman v. Superman stodginess, the X-Men franchise still doesn't feel entirely of-the-moment. So it's not a surprise that big portions of their marketing campaign feel distinctly youngs-friendly.

Absolutely not. Is it inoffensive and fine? Sure. Despite starring Internet darling Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: Apocalypse has a bit of a star power problem--at least where social is concerned. J-Law shines on late-night TV (and rakes in next-day YouTube views), but she hasn't done much more than that, and she's pretty clearly on her way out of the franchise. In the age of personality-driven viral marketing, Shipp and Turner and Hoult are too unfamiliar to rest a campaign on. If you want evidence, just check the total retweets and favorites that the above tweets--then compare that to this single, banal Hugh Jackman tweet.

While the standalone X-Men Movies app was basically a clunkier, X-centric Instagram, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to finish what Deadpool's Tinder account started. The Apocalypse marketing team bought out Snapchats's lenses for a day, and replaced them with ones that literally turned Snapchat users into X-Men. TK PHOTOS Not everyone was happy that it was now mandatory for them to become X-Men rather than a cute dog and someone puking a rainbow, but this was actually legitimately cool. (Snapchat also debuted a new feature where you could buy X-Men: Apocalypse tickets in-app.) So: points for effort and creativity, but demerits for the fact that the movie tried to make us put its faces on our faces. Which is maybe the most 2016 thing we've written in some time. The (Defensive) Aftermath Maybe because things never quite clicked with the whole viral marketing thing, publicity efforts seem to have taken a sharp right. For a number of days now, the movie's official Twitter account has been a retweet machine, and the message they're trying to drive home is pretty unambiguous. #XMenApocalypse was better than some of the harshest reviews suggest. Some great scenes honouring the comics heritage. Good fun. -- Sir Jay Brane-Jarr (@thebraininajar) May 26, 2016 Don't agree with all the bad reviews of #XMenApocalypse .

Calm down, and listen to Liz Lemon: Regardless of critical response, the X-Men are always going to have a place in our hearts, in nerd culture, and in the multiplex. It's just maybe not going to be right there alongside Batman or the Avengers. Embrace your nature, X-Men promotional campaign engineers: There's so much more to you than you know. Go Back to Top.

Now, the famous futurist has finally revealed one of the projects his team has been working on: chatbots that can talk like humans do. He lifted the veil on the big G's chatbot initiative at the latest Singularity conference -- an annual conference on science, tech and the future. Although Kurzweil didn't spill a lot of details, he did say that one of those chatbots is named Danielle. Since it's based on a character he wrote for one of his unpublished novels, we're guessing they're feeding it samples of his writing to give it the personality he envisions. The futurist is known for his prediction that AIs will pass the Turing test in 2029, and developing these bots is a step in that direction. Kurzweil says they're planning to release some of the chatbots they've been working on later this year. Hopefully, Google learned from Microsoft's experience, so Danielle doesn't turn out like Tay."

It triggers the appropriate response to prevent even greater injuries or even to save your life. A couple of German researchers think so too, so they're working on a way to make robots ""feel"" -- or, more accurately, to detect and respond to -- pain. That way, they can move away from anything that could damage them, thereby lengthening their lifespans and preventing the need for costly repairs. Johannes Kuehn and Professor Sami Haddadin from the Leibniz University of Hannover presented their work at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Sweden last week. In the video below, you can see them demonstrating their ""nervous robot-tissue model that is inspired by the human skin structure"" on a robotic arm. The robotic nervous system classifies pain as light, moderate (such as strong collisions) or severe (anything that can damage the machine). Each type triggers an appropriate response, as they explained in their ICRA paper: ""In the [light] pain class, such contacts occur that may harm the robot or prevent it from performing the task. The robot ""feels"" uncomfortable and shall smoothly retract until the contact event is over and return thereafter. Strong collisions are covered in the [moderate] pain class. The robot ""feels"" moderate pain, shall quickly retract, and more distant until the contact event is over. Then, it may move back. The [severe] pain class covers all contacts in which the robot may be damaged and thus needs some sort of ""help."" In order to prevent making the damage worse, the robot switches to gravity compensation with additional damping for dissipation, improving the safety of the robot and the environment by its strictly passive behavior. While the research could lead to more human-like robots than ever, it could also benefit other types of machines. The ability to feel pain could, for instance, help protect industrial machines used in factories."

Perhaps you'd like to stay in and do some binge-watching? Netflix has plenty to help you with that impulse. From six hours of awesome dino action to a whole new season of the massively addicting Orange Is the New Black, there's quite a bit coming to the streaming service this month to fill the days. Here's the programming you should prioritize this June. June 1 Jurassic Park (1993)/ The Lost World (1997) / Jurassic Park III (2001) This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!) But the the three original Jurassic movies are a fine Plan B in the absence of prehistoric thrills at the cineplex. All together, it's around six hours of (mostly) amazing dinosaur action. Say goodbye to a Saturday. This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!) But the the three original Jurassic movies are a fine Plan B in the absence of prehistoric thrills at the cineplex. All together, it's around six hours of (mostly) amazing dinosaur action. Say goodbye to a Saturday. June 10 Voltron: Legendary Defender (2016) The reboots of cartoons from the 1980s continues with Netflix's Voltron. The original series was about five young pilots who find flying lion robots and combine them into one giant warrior. In the new show, five students at a flight academy stumble upon one of the lions, and get whisked away to become a team and defend the universe. Get excited, cartoon fans.

June 17 Orange Is The New Black, Season 4 (2016) Jenji Kohan's Netflix Original has come a long way from the early days of Piper Chapman at Litchfield Penitentiary, adding in backstories for many different inmates along the way. The fourth season will continue last year's for-profit prison storyline as Litchfield adds more guards, restricts the inmates even further, and sees tensions ratchet up to new levels.

June 22 Spotlight (2015) This year's Oscar winner for Best Picture, about the Boston Globe journalists who uncovered a long history of abuse within the Catholic Church, is by no means a flashy movie, but it's persistent and picks its moments of stylistic emphasis carefully. It's the latest film to carry on the legacy of All The President's Men and Zodiac, illuminating the people who put in hours of hard work to bring stories to the public.

June 24 The Fundamentals of Caring (2016) Fundamentals stars Paul Rudd as a grieving father who takes a job as the caregiver for a teenager with a rare disease. They embark on a road trip to see tourist traps, and along the way connect with a foul-mouthed runaway. If that sounds like a movie made from the spare parts of a million Sundance films, it is. But that also makes it worth a watch. Fundamentals stars Paul Rudd as a grieving father who takes a job as the caregiver for a teenager with a rare disease.

June 30 Palio (2015) Twice each summer, in the central square of Siena, Italy, 10 of the city's 17 neighborhoods have a horse and rider race three times around a dirt track. Aside from prohibiting murder, there are essentially no rules. In this doc about the event--known as the Palio di Siena--the producers follow the story of a veteran jockey and his former apprentice, now rivals in the fiercest horse race this side of Churchill Downs.

It's not designed to help you."" The president sounded at turns exasperated and confounded as he addressed the people of Elkhart, Indiana, a town he last visited during the throes of the recession in 2009, and which he said he chose today ""precisely because this county votes Republican."" ""If the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you who will have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class,"" Obama told the crowd before laying out what he believes the differences between those visions are. For Obama, the speech was a chance to boast about his administration's economic achievements--including the country's consistent job growth and a shrinking deficit--while bashing the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who Obama believes would derail that progress. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama took Trump to task over everything from his tax policies to immigration to trade to his ""provocative"" tweets. ""I'm not here looking for votes,"" Obama said. ""I'm here because I care deeply as a citizen about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over the last seven and a half years."" Populist POTUS Not that Obama shied away from sounding the kind of populist note that has characterized the 2016 campaign season. He called Trump's proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants ""a fantasy"" and rejected the idea that immigrants are responsible for stagnating wages in this country. Instead, he laid the blame on another popular target--corporate elites. ""Those decisions are made in the board rooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker,"" he said. He went on to frame Trump as a candidate who only has the interests of the rich at heart. He attacked Trump's plans to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, and lambasting his proposed tax plan which would provide a major tax cut to the top .1 percent of American earners. ""That will not make your lives better,"" Obama said. ""That will help people like him."" Trade-offs On trade, Obama called the idea that ""other countries are killing us on trade,"" which is a frequent Trump talking point, a myth. He argued, instead, that while trade and technological advancement have hurt certain industries, they've helped others, like agriculture and technology. He also emphasized the importance of trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership in dictating the terms of trade. ""If you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century, and they're trying, then TPP makes sure we set the rules,"" Obama said. On that point, at least, Obama was not just fighting Trump's anti-trade rhetoric. Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have publicly opposed the deal as well. With that exception, the president's talk could have easily been ripped from the stump speeches of either of the Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. On nearly every economic issue--from pay equity to labor standards to investment in infrastructure--Obama painted a doomsday scenario on the right. ""When I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention,"" Obama said. ""If we fall for a bunch of okey doke, just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.""

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Donald Trump election 2016 President Barack Obama This weekend's Nevada Democratic State Convention looked like something out of a Donald Trump rally--which is to say, it was marked by chaotic protests, violent threats, and flying projectiles. On Saturday night, Bernie Sanders' supporters reportedly revolted against the Nevada Democratic Party, accusing it of intentionally rigging the convention to favor Hillary Clinton. The fight continued throughout the weekend as aggrieved Sanders supporters deluged Nevada Democratic Chair Roberta Lange with sexist and threatening texts and voicemails. Today, the Vermont senator issued a statement condemning any instances of violence carried out by his supporters. At the same time, he denounced what he called a corrupt system within the Nevada state party. ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,"" Sanders said in a statement. But, he added: ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" At issue is the fact that though Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign has been actively organizing to win county conventions. By amassing more delegates at these county conventions, the Sanders campaign stood to cut into Clinton's delegate lead at the statewide convention. But the Nevada State Democratic Party denied credentials to 64 of Sanders' delegates, saying that they either weren't registered as Democrats or that their records couldn't be verified. In the end, six of them received credentials, but the vote still tipped in Clinton's favor. The room soon erupted in protests. Meanwhile, the chaotic scene has created waves within Sanders' massive Reddit community as well. Moderators are urging Sanders supporters to avoid the kind of language that could get them in trouble with the media. ""They're  expecting  us to act this way. If we take the bait and react violently and/or with threats of violence, we play right into their hands,"" one moderator wrote. ""Remember, what would Bernie do?"" Setting aside the issue of violence, however, it's a little ironic to see the Sanders campaign accusing the state party of rigging the contest. Sanders has often criticized party leaders for trying to subvert the will of the people. But in this case, it's Clinton who won the Nevada caucus to begin with and Sanders who's using the cryptic system of delegate math to gain the edge.

RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it anymore. Last night, in a Tweetstorm for the ages, the Florida Senator let loose a torrent of frustrations about what has been the most absurd election cycle in recent memory. And can you blame him? It's been a rough year for Rubio. Once thought to be the Republican party's great hope, instead he spent this election cycle being repeatedly ridiculed for his height, his urge to stay well hydrated, his possibly overactive sweat glands, and more. He not only lost his home state of Florida, but he opted not to run for re-election to the Senate. With the exception of his Marcorobot meltdown during the New Hampshire debate, the young Senator mostly retained his composure. But with just months left until he's a private citizen again, Rubio is taking a note straight from the Donald Trump playbook, and telling it like it is on Twitter. The flint to Rubio's fire last night seemed to have been a Washington Post article alleging that he is ""betwixt and between"" on his next move. Funny to read about unnamed ""people close"" to me who claim to know my thinking on future plans.They just make it up. https://t.co/jiEYMugVHz -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Unnamed sources ""close to"" often just people who want to sound like they are in the know.

Words I have NEVER said to anyone. https://t.co/VZ9J7wznsZ -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Then Rubio really upped the attitude: Another genius line claims that Im ""a bit at sea in terms of his next step politically"".

Twitter isn't something you should just rush back into. You have to slowly increase the dosage....... -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Let's dispel with this fiction that Marco Rubio doesn't know what he's doing.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

It's just what he does. But how difficult would this actually be? Yes, I know Captain America is just a comic book hero, but that doesn't mean this won't be a fun physics problem. How do you model a thrown shield reflecting off different surfaces? Really, that's the difficult part. Let me go ahead and start with some assumptions. The speed of the shield doesn't matter. I will assume it ""flies"" like an airplane wing so it will follow a level trajectory and not drop as it travels. In the comic books, the shield is made from vibranium. Let's assume this allows perfectly elastic collisions with different surfaces. As I showed before, a completely elastic collision can obey the ""law of reflection"". This means that when the shield hits a wall, the angle of incidence will be equal to the angle of reflection. I think that's enough to start making a model. It's not difficult to make a shield move at a constant speed, but the reflection off a wall isn't so straightforward. Here's three questions you have to ask: Does the shield even hit the wall? When and where is the collision with the wall? What is the reflected velocity vector given the orientation of the wall and the incoming velocity? Yes, it would be fairly easy to model this in the case of a wall that is only in the y-direction (up/down), but I want a more generic reflection. First, how do we know if there is a collision? There are several methods for collision detection (it's an important part of many video games) but I want to create my own. Suppose I have a wall with a length of L, oriented in some direction, and a shield moving toward it. The first thing I am going to do is to find the position of the two end points for the wall (P1 and P2). Now I can calculate the distance from P1 and P2 to the position of the shield. If the shield is intersecting this wall, the sum of these distances should equal L. Here is a diagram: If I calculate these distances as vectors, the sum of the magnitudes of r1 and r2 (from P1 and P2 to the shield) will only equal L if the center of the shield is between the two points. If the shield is outside the points or not yet to the wall, their sum will exceed L. A couple of things to notice. First, I am just dealing with this wall in 2-D, but this method should work in 3-D. Second, I don't care about the size of the shield--I am merely dealing with it as a point object. I don't think this matters for playing with collisions with a wall (we could change this later if it bothers you). Now for the reflection. This is trickier and my method only works in 2-D so the shield moves in the x-y plane. If I create a wall in VPython (Glowscript), there are some properties of this object which is technically a ""box."" There is the position of the center of the box, the size of the box and the ""axis."" The axis is a vector that is perpendicular to the box to describe its orientation. Here is a diagram showing the shield colliding with the wall. The two important vectors are the velocity and the axis. Here I have a as the angle between the incident velocity vector and the axis vector. You can find this angle by first finding the dot product between these two vectors and using the following relationship: Finding the dot product for vectors is simple if you know the vector in component form (the x,y,z components). It's also simple to find the magnitude of these vectors. So, in the end you get the angle between these two vectors. Oh, it's even easier since both the dot product (dot) and the vector magnitude (mag) are built in functions in VPython. But what I really need is the angle th which shows the amount I would have to rotate the original vector. Based on my drawing, this vector th would be: Now that I have the rotation angle, I need to rotate the vector. I can use the rotation matrix in 2-D. Here is the xkcd version of the rotation matrix. It's funnier than the actual matrix. So, that's pretty simple. Now let's put it all together. Actually, this is sort of like a video game. So I made a video game. Just drag the arrow to pick the direction you wish to aim the shield. The goal is to bounce the shield off the wall and hit the blue circle. If you successfully hit the circle, it turns yellow. If you miss, just press play and try again. The code is a little messy--but you can check it out here. I'll probably make a screencast in which I go over the different parts of this program. Once you play with this program, you might notice it's not so trivial to aim at the wall and hit the target. You can do it, but only with a little bit of guesswork. How about something a bit more complicated? What if the reflected surface isn't a flat wall but a curved surface? In this case we can still assume that the incident and reflected angle are still equal. However, there is a big difference. Now if you hit the curved surface at a slightly different point, it will have a different axis about which it will reflect. In terms of coding, it's actually an easier program to create. Collision detection is simpler. All I need to do is determine the distance from the center of the curved wall to the center of the shield. If this distance is less than the sum of their radii, then they ""hit."" After that, I merely need to calculate the vector that is equivalent to the axis vector for the wall. There is one problem that I encountered--depending on where the shield hits, it could reflect either to the left or the right. By finding the angle between the incident velocity vector and the ""axis"" I can determine the direction of rotation in the rotation matrix. Here is the same ""game"" with a curved surface. (the code) Pretty tough, right? Of course Captain America is better than all of you at this. He can bounce his shield off multiple surfaces and score a ""hit."" Are you ready to try two bounces? Try to hit the curved surface and then the wall and then target. Here is the code. If you score a hit on your first try, you should be an Avenger. And if you want some homework, here are a few suggestions. Make a plot of initial velocity angle vs. deflected angle. How does this plot look for both the flat and curved wall? You might prefer to make a plot of initial angle vs. final y-position or something. What if you put in a third object to deflect the shield? Is it even solvable? Can you make the computer program find an angle that would score a hit? What about non-elastic collisions? Yes, that would be a little bit more difficult--but still fun. Go Back to Top.

Clearly, Square Enix's title is inspired by the block-building phenomenon developed by Mojang. But the two play quite differently -- Builders is a more structured adventure with clear objectives and villagers to help. The game launched on PS4, PS3 and PS Vita in January, but that was only for Japan. Today, Square Enix has confirmed it'll be coming to the West too. For now, that means a PS4 and PS Vita (digital-only) release across Europe this October. There's no word yet on a US release date, however. I played the new, localized version for roughly 30 minutes and came away pleasantly surprised. It's set after the original Dragon Quest and explores what might have happened after the so-called ""bad"" ending, where you choose not to fight the Dragonlord. The world of Alefgard is ruined and you wake up with no memories (surprise, surprise) and the power to build. Your task is to venture out into the world and teach the art of creative construction to everyone you meet, healing the land along the way. The characters, items and monsters are all Dragon Quest-themed, offsetting the blocky visuals taken from Minecraft. I enjoyed the simple quests, which served to explain the crafting system and blueprints -- unlockable patterns which you set on the ground and build on top of. Once you've laid down the necessary number of blocks, and thrown a pre-determined list of items inside, the game recognises that you've built a certain structure. Villagers can then use and inhabit them, building out your tiny empire. It won't be for everyone, but if you fall into one of two camps -- a diehard Dragon Quest fan, or someone that's been looking for a more guided and focused Minecraft experience -- this could be up your alley."

The project racked up $1.5 million during a Kickstarter campaign in 2013, but it wasn't enough to get the project off the ground. While they won't be getting a photo of themselves from space, the 17,000-plus backers will at least be getting their money back. The project was supposed to use a specially modified Arkyd 100 telescope mounted with a second camera pointed at an external screen that would display a user's picture and snap an extraterrestrial selfie. The company even promised users they could point the telescope at the backdrop of their choice (as long as it wasn't the sun) and a majority of the project's backers paid $25 for space selfie option. Another 27 contributors shelled out $10,000 for tickets to the selfie-scope's launch, which obviously isn't happening at this point. ""It's a decision that we make with a heavy heart,"" Planetary Resources CEO Chris Lewicki told GeekWire. While the crowdsourcing campaign shot past their expectations, Lewicki says his company couldn't find the right partner to turn this into a real space mission. Although the selfie-shooting satellite was a failure to launch, Planetary Resources is still preparing to put ""a constellation of Arkyd 100 telescopes"" in orbit by the end of 2019. Those satellites are designed for thermal infrared and hyperspectral Earth photography, however, so you might still technically be in the picture, but you'll be a lot harder to spot."

When the 2015-2016 season began, the league included 100 international players (out of 446 total) from 37 countries. The Association's popularity is still growing internationally, thanks to a combination of international outreach, technological savvy, and openness--as crystallized by these eight marquee moments that helped the basketball go global. 1992 The Dream Team In 1989, FIBA, the international governing body of basketball, decided to allow professional players in the NBA could be just like professionals in other leagues around the world, and compete in international tournaments. Despite then-commissioner David Stern's misgivings, the United States sent the Dream Team to Barcelona for the 1992 Summer Olympics, and finally the best basketball players in the world had the attention of an international audience. The superstar-laden roster is legendary--Jordan, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Johnson, Bird, Ewing, Mullin, Robinson, Barkley, Drexler (and Laettner, the only non-Hall of Famer)--and utterly dominated the tournament, where they won games by an average of 44 points. The public reception in Spain was ecstatic--coach Chuck Daly likened it to ""Elvis and The Beatles put together""--and the team's effect on the game was immediately felt. Then-IOC chair Juan Antonion Samaranch called the basketball tournament ""the most important aspect of the Games.""

But the most important step toward mass-audience international broadcasting was getting the league's games on the air in China.

But the league decided to follow Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League and expand to Canada, founding the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors, making the ""National"" in its name a bit of a misnomer. Unfortunately, the Grizziles didn't last long in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, but the Raptors have held on in Toronto, making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history this season.

It took many years for streaming technology to be so widely available and fast that fans would demand access to games via the internet, but broadcasting internet audio in the 1990s shows an impressive amount of foresight, even as an experiment. 1998 Kobe Bryant's First Trip to Asia The typical cycle of a young superstar player eventually reaches the point where they get old and retire, and are replaced by a new crop of young superstars. But that's not true for Michael Jordan, whose pioneering shoe endorsements paved the way for almost every significant player since. And it's also not true of recently-retired Kobe Bryant, who remains one of the most popular players overseas even as his career precipitously declined in the NBA. Much of that popularity can be traced back to the first international trip he took to Australia, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines before the 1998-1999 season. Since then, he's gone back an additional nine times--his 2015 Asian Summer Tour with Nike hit Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Taipei. Bryant is the model for international basketball stardom, not simply doing his work on the court during the season, but taking the time to develop an iconic persona everywhere in the world people play and watch basketball. Few players have marketed themselves individually to international fans with lucrative and enduring success quite like Bryant.

(The essential 30 For 30 installment Once Brothers traces the bond between eastern European stars Vlade Divac and Drazen Petrovic in the late 1980s and early 1990s.) But the decade after the Dream Tream saw international players emerge on a level previously unseen in the NBA. German wunderkind Dirk Nowitzki, who impressed Charles Barkley during international camps as a teenager, arrived in 1998 and by the early 2000s had begun a streak of 10 consecutive All-Star appearances. And the 2000 draft saw 14 international players selected, with seven in the first round. But seven-foot six-inch Chinese center Yao Ming, taken first overall by the Houston Rockets in 2002, is perhaps the most significant international player in the history of the NBA. While other international players had more success on the court, Yao was an unmissable icon who gave millions of Chinese fans a patriotic reason to follow the NBA. Though he only played eight (injury-shortened) seasons and made the playoffs four times in Houston, his cultural impact was so undeniable that Yao was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Allen Iverson and Shaquille O'Neal in 2016.

But since joining, the league has been by leaps and bounds the most savvy official league account with regard to engaging with fans and cultivating new ones using wide-reaching social media channels. The league doesn't just employ a hands-off approach to fans enthusiastically circulating highlights, it actively encourages users to share videos and pictures that help continue conversations about dunks, long threes, incredible passes, or controversial moments. Takedown notices are nowhere to be found. Instead, NBA Twitter is a raucous and celebratory environment where every great play can be looped millions of times, and every tragic loss gets a Crying Jordan within the hour. And that makes it the most fun sport to watch at home while following along with the conversation online.

Two cameras--one stationed courtside and another up in the rafters, beamed video to Samsung Gear VR users via the NextVR app. Front-row experiences vary by sport. It's arguably more fun to be in the stands where it's possible to catch a foul ball or a home run in baseball instead of behind the plate. And football is best viewed where it's possible to see the whole field of play. But basketball is exhilarating from up close, and because the court is small enough it's still possible to see everything going on from that vantage point. VR livestreams have expanded to other big-time sporting events (the U.S. Open) and other limited-access experiences (this year's Coachella music festival offered 360 video for its main stage), but it's entirely possible that in the foreseeable future, NBA League Pass will include some kind of provision for courtside VR viewing at a fraction of the cost of an actual ticket. And watching in VR means you're not part of the problem if your team's star player goes headfirst into the stands and nobody steps in to catch him.
