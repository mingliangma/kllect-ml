Aluminium batteries developed at other laboratories usually died after just 100 charge-discharge cycles. But the Stanford battery was able to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity. This was the first time an ultra-fast aluminum-ion battery was constructed with stability over thousands of cycles. By comparison, a typical lithium-ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles. Another feature of the aluminum battery is flexibility.  You can bend it and fold it, so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices. Aluminum is also a cheaper metal than lithium. In addition to small electronic devices, aluminium batteries could be used to store renewable energy on the electrical grid.

It had been four years since he'd graduated from high school with hopes of attending a four-year college. But year after year, at school after school, his applications were rejected. Four years on, just as his high school friends were preparing to graduate from college, their whole lives seemingly ahead of them, Casas was languishing. ""They were like, 'But you were such a good student in high school,'"" Casas remembers his friends saying. The truth was, Casas knew why he couldn't get into school, but he also knew he couldn't tell his friends. To tell anyone the truth--that he was an undocumented immigrant, a secret he kept for 13 long years--was to risk being taken away from his family, his friends, and the only home he'd known since his parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was 8. Related Stories Even Conservatives Say Trump's Immigration Plan Is Dystopian Zuckerberg-backed Site: Immigration Stance Could Doom GOP Tech Giants Back Immigrants In Upcoming Supreme Court Fight ""I got really sad and depressed,"" he says. ""You stop thinking of yourself as a human being, and you start thinking of yourself as a number."" The second time Casas considered suicide was last February after a Texas court blocked President Obama's expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama's executive order would have allowed people like Casas who came to the US as children to get a work permit and exemption from deportation. Casas was now 35, and thanks to the kindness of one admissions officer, he had eventually received a bachelor's degree and MBA from the University of Maryland. Still, without a work permit, the only job Casas could find, even with his degrees, was as a personal trainer. DACA, he believed, would be his ticket to the career he'd worked so long and hard for. ""Once DACA got shut down I was like, 'I'm out of options. There's nothing left,"" Casas says. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. It was risky, Casas knew, but it wasn't unheard of. Starting in 2010, an intrepid group of young undocumented immigrants in Chicago launched the Coming Out of the Shadows campaign. They uploaded videos to YouTube, telling the world that they were undocumented. Since then, thousands more videos have landed on YouTube. Undocumented people have created page after page on Facebook. They've used the hashtag #UndocumentedandUnafraid to band together and share their stories on Twitter. And advocacy groups like Define American have sprouted up with the explicit purpose of getting undocumented people and their allies to reshape their own narrative using the tools of the Internet. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. Casas decided it was time to join this movement. So he reached out to Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and founder of Define American. Vargas came out as undocumented in the pages of The New York Times Magazine in 2011 and in the process became perhaps the most public face of the undocumented community. Like Casas, Vargas knows all too well what it's like to carry the weight of isolation for so long. He had never even met another undocumented person his age until he was 28. ""I found out I was undocumented in 1997, and it was like, you couldn't Google it,"" Vargas says. ""There was no social networking to be done. So it just goes inside of you. You internalize it. It eats you up and grows into this kind of tumor in a way."" It's no wonder, then, that mounting research is finding that undocumented youths and the children of undocumented immigrants often suffer, like Casas, with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. But the connective powers--and relative anonymity--of the Internet are starting to break down these walls of secrecy, finally enabling undocumented people to find each other and remind each other that they're not as alone as they think they are. ""I would argue this is the first civil rights movement that has grown up in social media,"" says Vargas, who launched Define American's Coming Out campaign last summer. Telling the World Just as important as telling these stories to one another is sharing these stories with the world, say members of the coming-out movement. That's particularly true in an election cycle in which presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has tried to cast undocumented immigrants as a blight on the country. Trump has famously promised to deport the estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a threat one might expect would dissuade people like Casas from coming out. Instead, he says, it's motivated him. ""I thought, what if I told the world: 'Hey America, this is what an undocumented immigrant looks like, and by the way, we're not rapists,'"" Casas says. ""I'm at a point in my life where it's like, help me or deport me. Don't leave me in limbo."" The connective powers and relative anonymity of the Internet are starting to break down walls of secrecy. Casas isn't the only one who's been compelled to speak out in the era of Trump. Thomas Kim, a law student at Arizona State University, also recently reached out to Define American to discuss how he could safely come out. ""The conversation about immigration got more hostile and more harsh,"" Kim says. ""I wanted to break the stereotypes that undocumented students are lazy, and they don't speak English."" On a surface level, it seems, people like Casas, Vargas, and Kim are putting themselves at risk. And yet many have found that by speaking out, they become part of a network that can protect them in the long run. ""It's sort of like a safety network,"" says Erika Andiola, an undocumented immigrant who came to the US from Mexico when she was 11. Andiola began working as an immigrant rights organizer in 2008, after Arizona passed a law that banned undocumented immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. By 2013, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided her home in Arizona, taking her mother and brother with them, Andiola's online network was already vast. ""My first reaction was: 'I'm going to put it on YouTube and let people know,'"" Andiola remembers. ""These types of things happen everyday. Raids. Deportations, but nobody talks about it."" The Power of Sharing The video, which features a sobbing Andiola moments after the raid, received 60,000 views within 12 hours. It included a phone number for ICE that people could call to demand Andiola's family be returned to Arizona. And it worked. The following day, her family members were released, and Andiola wrote the following message on Facebook: ""My mom was on [her] way to Mexico. She said the driver turned around when she received a call. She was really confused, than they told her that the reason why she was returning was because her daughter was mobilizing the whole country to get her to come back. The reality is, you all made it happen!"" Now, as Bernie Sanders' national press secretary for Latino outreach, Andiola regularly tells that story in front of crowds of thousands. 'No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts.' Of course, not everyone's coming out story has a happy ending. Last November, in an essay published in The Huffington Post, Casas told the world he was undocumented. The next day, he wrote a lengthy Facebook post about it and later went on to upload a video of himself telling his story on YouTube. But while these messages make Casas appear defiant, he says, ""my life has gotten so much harder."" Over the last year, Casas, who is still a personal trainer, says exposing his legal status has cost him income, several clients, and a few friendships. There were the anonymous attacks, too. ""No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts,"" he says. And yet, Casas says he doesn't regret his decision to come out. ""Sharing my story and hearing how people felt about me, I gained the most incredible gift I could imagine,"" he says. Recently, he's begun volunteering with undocumented kids in his area, because he says, ""I would have killed to know someone like me when I was 18."" Still, he says there are plenty of days he considers getting in his car, driving to the border, and self-deporting. But there's one thing that stops him, he says: ""I know these kids are watching me."" Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 immigration Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

(Rumors & News & Leaks)"	"youtube.com"	"In this video, you'll find the latest rumors about the Apple Watch 2nd generation, which has a release date of April 2016 - maybe. Some of the biggest rumours include speculation about whether Apple will include a FaceTime camera in the bezel of the watch, and whether the company will include a thinner display panel to accommodate a larger battery. Web pages mentioned in this video: APPLE INSIDER: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/07/02/rumor-apple-watch-2-will-add-bigger-battery-look-exactly-the-same- http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/21/next-apple-watch-extremely-unlikely-to-get-facetime-video-calling TECH NEWS TODAY: http://www.technewstoday.com/24800-apple-watch-2-will-not-have-major-changes-except-a-better-battery/ INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TIMES: http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apple-watch-2-facetime-camera-battery-life-price-launch-date-all-rumours-so-far-1507348 -- Please subscribe to HandyAndy Tech Tips! It would really help me out a lot. -- PARTIAL VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: Hi, it's HandyAndy Tech Tips here. Now the Apple Watch was a hotly anticipated device, and, for the most part, has been a success, with UBS analyst Steven Milunovich predicting that 31 million units will be sold in the first year of its availability. But it does have a few problems, with one of these being battery life. Many Apple Watch owners have been complaining that the device needs to be charged every day, and now it looks like Apple is set to address these concerns. According to Apple Insider, Apple is working with LG and Samsung to create a thinner display panel for the next version of the watch, which has been dubbed the ""Apple Watch 2"". The thinner display will allow the company to put a larger battery in the watch without changing its design. To other rumours, and the next-gen Apple Watch will reportedly retain the same screen resolution and size as the original model, and will not have a round display like some Android Wear smartwatches. And according to technewstoday.com, it may be a standalone device, able to make calls and receive notifications without an iPhone, which would be pretty cool. But there are some arguments about the most exciting potential feature in the second-gen Apple Watch: a FaceTime camera. Just one week ago, the International Business Times were speculating that Apple may include a front-facing camera to make video calls. Then Apple Insider claimed that the watch was extremely unlikely to get FaceTime video calling. They said that packing a camera into the bezel would be a major engineering feat because the components inside the watch are packed very densely and there might not be enough space inside the case to include a camera, and the bezel of the current-gen Watch is curved at the edge, and, if a camera was placed underneath it, severe distortions of the resulting image would occur. So maybe you can forget about making FaceTime calls, but who knows? Apple might just introduce them, and make the Dick Tracys of the world very happy indeed. So that's about all the tech world currently knows about the second gen Apple Watch. Please subscribe if you enjoyed this video.

Jared Leto's a fan and so is Jean-Michel Jarre, who sent her to live with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon. She's modeled for Diesel and composed for German theater. She's conducted magnetic resonance imaging studies on mutated HIV cells and had paintings featured in galleries in New York. She taught herself the piano at age 10. At 15, she successfully petitioned the Los Angeles courts to be home-schooled; one year later, she enrolled at the University of Maryland. Her upcoming album incorporates the synthesized sounds of actual stars, physics themes and pitch-shifting conspiracies linked to Bob Marley and Hitler. Her list of professional accomplishments puts other so-called pop culture multihyphenates to shame. She is Simonne Jones, and you will know her name. Gravity, her forthcoming EP (due out May 27th on Universal Germany) and moody first single, explores a familiar theme: the push and pull of an irresistible lover. But this being a Simonne Jones' joint, that heartache is wrapped in a blanket of industrial beats and physics-based metaphor. ""You've set me in motion / The stars are blurs around the sun / The push and pull, the force of your body / Closer you get, I'm overcome / Bound by attraction / Floating on axis / Around your atlas / You're holding me like gravity, all around."" In less skilled hands, this scientific approach to lyrical matters of the heart could've come off as ham-handed, and run the risk of alienating listeners from the song's emotional content by shoehorning it within dense concepts. Yet, it succeeds, lending to the seductive timbre of Jones' soft voice, because this is how her mind works. As her resume can attest, Jones is equal parts creative and analytical; right- and left-brained. ""The problem-solving processes around math and music are really similar in terms of pattern recognition and the type of out of the box thinking,"" says Jones, 29, speaking to me over Skype from her adopted home of Berlin. ""And for me, I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science ... and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science. It's like why are we exploring the unknown and why are we looking for patterns in the universe to make predictions and what it all means. And when you like art, thinking really hard about that, it becomes this creative process."" Image credit: Till Janz Though it's tempting to believe all pop stars-in-the-making are contrivances borne of the music industry, Jones' tendency to wax philosophical is not a calculated quirk designed to make her more marketable. Nor is her scientific knowledge base merely some gimmick she leverages for dramatic effect. In fact, it pervades her forthcoming EP. One song in particular, Spooky Action, is inspired by Einstein's theory of quantum entanglement. ""It's the most romantic idea in the whole world,"" says Jones. ""That you have two particles and they're combined on the nuclear level. And you get separated, even if it's by an entire universe. But mysteriously and instantaneously, whatever you do to one, will happen to the other. They remain connected forever. I love that idea."" Given the themes threading through her work, it's clear that Jones, whose own life has defied convention and been guided by extraordinary serendipity, is enamoured with and inspired by the greater mysteries surrounding our universe. Take, for example, the conspiracy theory Jones latched onto and, alongside producer Liam Howe, experimented with in the creation of many of Gravity's tracks: pitch shifting to 432Hz. In the Western musical scale, the note 'A' above middle 'C' is designated as 440Hz, an arbitrary standard set by the International Organization for Standardization in the mid-1950s. But that frequency, so the conspiracy theory goes, is unharmonious to the human body and environment -- and it's rumored that Hitler even used this as a means to provoke feelings of anger and aggression by playing it for crowds during his speeches. Tuning to 432Hz, however, supposedly makes for a more natural and comforting sound. Bob Marley, Beethoven and Prince are said to have dabbled with composing works tuned at 432Hz, though no concrete evidence of this exists. ""432Hz... it just feels more therapeutic and just relaxing, calm. And then that 440Hz is a little bit more tension. It doesn't ride into you like a summer wave,"" says Jones. Born in Hollywood and raised around LA, Jones, who has mostly Cherokee and Caribbean roots along with Italian, French and Irish ancestry, is an entirely self-made creature. She does not come from a musical background and, her recent Peaches tutelage excepted, owes her virtuosity to a well-trained ear and the sort of color-coded, teach yourself to play books found in the library. At age 11, Jones quickly progressed from playing very basic songs on the piano to mastering Beethoven and Chopin, writing her own compositions, and developing an appreciation for classical music along the way. As if that musical rearing wasn't prodigious enough, Jones leapfrogged past her peers in high school, successfully petitioning the courts to be homeschooled at age 15; a fast track that led to early college admission at the University of Maryland. It was there that she solidified her foothold in the worlds of art and science with a double major in biomedical research and visual arts and a double minor in biology and art history. That education led to a brief stint at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a biomedical engineering lab based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. But as with most of Jones' career twists and turns, fate intervened to indulge her artistic leanings: In 2012, having left Baltimore to pursue music in LA, Jones got a call from Peaches asking her to sub for a tech that had fallen ill. Soon after, she found herself touring Europe and trading LA's celebrity-adjacent glitz for Berlin's hipsterized Bohemia. ""I like to say that she threw me in a sack and kidnapped me and brought me to Berlin,"" says Jones. ""She's been like a really influential mentor keeping me from signing bad contracts."" Image credit: Yamaha Synths More than that, Jones credits Peaches for encouraging her to ditch modeling, which she'd undertaken on and off since the age of 16, and pursue music production. ""She kind of locked me in her studio and made me make beats and play on her analog synthesizers and get on her drum machines."" With Peaches as her guardian angel and Berlin's DIY music scene as her backdrop, Jones began merging her creative inclinations with that of technology and science, eventually securing an artist residency at Platoon Kunsthalle. ""I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science."" Simonne Jones ""I had no idea how to do this when I started,"" says Jones. ""But I'm like, okay, I'm a really good researcher and I'm going to figure this out. Everything is on the internet. ... Then it just exploded into this thing where I built midi controllers and synthesizers, and on / off switches. ... And then really building complex loop machines that were highly customized. And then I did this art installation in Berlin that was about different topics in physics and creating a little painting LED universe about the Big Bang all the way to thermodynamic laws. And then it just became this explosion of I guess just who I am -- this mashup of both worlds."" A stint modeling and performing at a Diesel runway show led to more gigs at various fashion events and art galleries, all of which culminated in Jones landing the cover of Germany's feminist-focused Missy Magazine. It was an achievement that, while it opened the door to many new opportunities, baffled Jones considering she hadn't released any music. ""You couldn't even find a song of mine on Spotify, or Soundcloud or iTunes, or anything like that. So it kind of like was the running joke: You haven't released any material and you're boring,"" she says of that early press attention. Image credit: Robin Thomson But it was precisely thanks to that bevy of premature coverage that Jones caught famed French composer and electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre's attention. Jarre, who at the time was partnering with UNESCO on a documentary designed to follow four artists to four different countries, had read an interview with Jones on music software production company Ableton's site, and selected her as one of the four. ""I was like, I'm going to Brazil and then talk to an indigenous tribe there. I want to go and live with them and sleep in the jungle in one of their jungle huts. And that was a really intense experience,"" she says of the Amazonian visit that saw her inducted into the Guarani tribe via a sacred music ritual. While there, Jones busied herself with recording ambient sounds, which were then turned into a ""Simonne Jones"" drum kit plug-in created by Native Instruments. Her musical meanderings -- which included a job composing music for the play Jedermann (Everyman in English) at the Thalia theatre and a gig opening for the Italian leg of Thirty Seconds to Mars' tour (better known as Jared Leto's band) -- eventually snagged her a recording contract with Universal Germany. She's since recorded with a wishlist of producers who've worked with the likes of Madonna, Adele, Florence Welch, RuPaul, Lana del Rey, Esthero, Kelis and Bat for Lashes. Image credit: Platoon Kunsthalle Of that bunch of producers, Jones seems to have formed a close bond with Howe, better known as one of the founding members of mid-90s trip hop band Sneaker Pimps. It was Howe who alerted Jones to the existence of recorded star frequencies, carried out by an observatory in Paris, and suggested she use them in the production of her debut album. After Howe successfully obtained the samples from a UK-based researcher, Jones began experimenting with these cosmic sounds. She describes the net effect as ""pads that are barely visible and very subliminal underneath the tracks, but definitely add this layer of atmosphere that's really spooky and kind of weird."" ""They sound like if a star could hum,"" she says. Ultimately, listeners will have to decide for themselves whether that celestial presence, in combination with the 432Hz frequency change, has any subtle effect on how positively they perceive the music on Jones' EP. But, regardless, it's further evidence of how she's striving to unite the seemingly disparate worlds of art and science that intermingle within her, rather than merely crafting an earworm song of the summer pop hook we'll be glad to forget come fall."

Instead, the world will have to wait until August to play developer Hello Games' ultra ambitious space-exploration game. Writing on the PlayStation Blog, lead developer Sean Murray says that the game will now launch this August 9th domestically and August 12th in the UK. The reason? He says a few bits weren't up to snuff. ""We understand that this news is disappointing,"" he writes. ""Making this game is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but we are so close now, and we're prepared to make the tough choices to get it right. Originally announced back in 2013, No Man's Sky only got a firm release date a couple of months ago. But the June 21st promise couldn't be kept. If you don't know anything about the game, it's a PlayStation 4 and PC title that allows players to explore a giant, procedurally generated universe. You'll be able to fly around roughly eighteen quintillion (that's a lot) planets, and disembark from your ship to explore each, cataloguing flora and fauna and completing challenges along the way. It's being made by Hello Games, a small UK-based developer previously known for the Joe Danger stunt games.

The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology[1][2] referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[3] Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, microfabrication, etc.[4] The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials,[5] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OU3YUhl1q7U/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/OU3YUhl1q7U"	"574c3003d48d0833e6740d27"	"ASUS' latest Transformers take heavy cues from Microsoft's Surface Engadget Engadget save share save share save share save share save share save share"	"Engadget"	"ASUS has just unveiled a line of new Transformer 2-in-1 PCs that look suspiciously like a certain product from Microsoft. With their touchscreens, kickstands (well, two of them have one at least) and portable keyboards, they do remind us a lot of, you guessed it, the Surface series of tablet PCs. And, of course, they all run Windows 10, which makes the Surface connection even more undeniable. Of the new announcements, the Transformer 3 Pro is the most advanced of the lot, the Transformer 3 sits somewhere in the middle, while the Mini is the lightest (and cutest). Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro and Transformer 3 launch event | 20 Photos 20 +16  Both the Transformer 3 Pro and the Transformer 3 have a 12.6-inch display with a 2880 x 1920 resolution, 275 ppi pixel density and wide viewing angles. There are other similarities as well: Both feature USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 connections, Harmon Kardon speakers, and USB 3.0 and HDMI ports. As you might expect, both 2-in-1s are also compatible with ASUS accessories such as the Pen, a Universal Dock, an AudioPod (a quad speaker with surround sound) and the ROG XG Station 2, a graphics dock that gives the humble tablet PC the power of a desktop computer (and it's VR-ready to boot!). Both tablets are available in Icicle Gold as well as Glacier Gray. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro press shots | 4 Photos 4 +1 Of the two, the Transformer 3 Pro is the heftier one at 8.35mm thick. Its kickstand has a ""stepless hinge"" that lets you set the device at any viewing angle up to 170 degrees. The 3 Pro also comes with a Cover Keyboard that's backlit and offers ""laptop-grade 1.4mm key travel"" which ASUS says will provide a typing experience similar to that of a normal-sized notebook. It also boasts an Intel Core i7 processor and up to 1TB PCIe x4 SSD and 16GB of 2133MHz RAM. It has a 13-megapixel rear camera plus a front-facing one as well. The Transformer 3 Pro uses its camera for facial recognition thanks to Windows Hello. After a brief hands-on time with the 3 Pro, I can see why this is being billed as the more ""professional"" of ASUS' new 2-in-1 PCs. It has a really sharp design and its all-metal chassis gives it a polished look. The keyboard snaps on magnetically and its chiclet keys felt pretty good when touch-typing at my usual rapid clip. I'm also a big fan of that ""stepless"" Smart Hinge, which felt pretty solid at almost every angle I could put it in. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro hands-on | 7 Photos 7 +3 While the Transformer 3 has the same display size as the Transformer 3 Pro, the 3 is thinner and lighter with a thickness and weight of 6.9mm and 695 grams respectively. The Transformer 3 features a 7th generation Intel Core processor plus up to 512GB SSD and up to 8GB of RAM. Unlike the Transformer 3 Pro, the Transformer 3 has a built-in fingerprint reader on the side. It ships with a Transformer Sleeve Keyboard, also with 1.4mm of key travel and is available in the same four colors as the Cover Keyboard (Stone, Charcoal, Taupe, and Amber). The 3 doesn't have a kickstand on its own -- in fact, it looks like a regular ol' tablet without the keyboard. If the Transformer 3 Pro is a Surface clone, the 3 is more of an iPad. That aforementioned Sleeve Keyboard essentially acts as the Transformer 3's display stand. It works much the same way as the Smart Covers for the iPad, in that it only has two positions; there's no stepless Smart Hinge here. Still, aside from that, its keys have the same clicky feel as the Pro 3's Cover Keyboard. I was pleasantly surprised by this, as I was expecting it to have squishy keys like the Surface's Touch Cover. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 press shots | 4 Photos 4 +1 If you think both of these tablets are just too big for your tastes, ASUS also offers the Transformer Mini. It has a 10.1-inch display, is 8.2mm thin and weighs 790 grams with the keyboard attached and 530 grams without. Like the Transformer Pro 3, it also has an integrated kickstand with that stepless smart hinge design that lets you view it at any angle you like. It too has a built-in fingerprint reader, though it's located on the rear instead of the side. Gallery: ASUS Transformer Mini press shots | 3 Photos 3 +1 The keyboard is a little smaller with 1.5mm key travel but it does have an integrated palm rest like the others. I found it a little less intuitive to type using the smaller keyboard, with my fingers landing on the wrong key every so often. My guess is that I would probably figure it out over time, but I'll have to try it for a few days to see. Other features include a ZenSync smartphone integration that lets you sync up your text messages much in the same way you can with iOS and OS X El Capitan. The Transformer Mini is powered by a quad-core Intel Atom X5 processor and promises up to 11 hours of battery life. The Transformer Mini and keyboard will ship in a variety of different colors such as Quartz Gray, Pearl White, Amber, Mint Green and Icicle Gold. Pricing for the ASUS Transformer 3 Pro starts at $999 while the Transformer 3 will start at $799. The Transformer Mini will start at around $349. No word on availability just yet, but we'll update you when we know."

Retail analysts have speculated the U.S. company is gearing up for a launch of Amazon Fresh in Britain next year. The new ""Amazon Pantry"" service offers Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee of 79 pounds, the choice of more than 4,000 ""everyday essentials, in everyday sizes"", including major brands of food and drink, household supplies, baby, child and pet care, health and beauty. Members can fill up as much of a 20 kg Amazon Pantry box as they wish for one-day delivery, with a 2.99 pound fee for the first box and 99 pence for each additional box in the same order. ""Amazon Pantry has been designed to take the heavy lifting out of replenishing the often bulky basics and store cupboard essentials that people need every day,"" Amazon Pantry manager at Amazon UK, Helene Parthenay, said. Amazon Pantry is already available in the United States, Germany and Japan. All of Britain's big four supermarkets - market leader Tesco, Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - have seen sales and profits hit as they cut prices to stem the flow of shoppers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl. All of the so called big four have online grocery offers, with Morrisons the last to enter the market through a tie-up with Ocado."

BUONAMICI via Getty Images Sorry, University of New South Wales: Your efforts at shattering the efficiency record for solar cells earlier this month have been, ahem, eclipsed. A group of researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a way to possibly break the maximum efficiency of a solar cell, the Shockley-Queisser Limit. The Shockley-Queisser tops off at around 32 percent, but that's taking standard solar cell setups into account. The MIT scientists switched it up and converted incoming sunlight to heat prior to having it generate electricity, a trick that could possibly double the power produced by a given panel. These solar thermophotovoltaics (above) take light and pass it through an intermediary part comprised of nanophotonic crystals that outputs thermal radiation -- something that's otherwise wasted using typical means. From there, the radiation is converted to the best-possible light wavelengths, via an optical filter, that a normal solar cell can use. The school says this method means that in the future, passing clouds or even total darkness (if a thermal storage system is in place) wouldn't affect the system's ability to gather and produce solar energy, respectively. And this is all with what the team refers to as ""unoptimized geometry."" Meaning, efficiency could go even higher than what was achieved during this experiment. Your day in the sun is over, UNSW."
