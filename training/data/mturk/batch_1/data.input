Aluminium batteries developed at other laboratories usually died after just 100 charge-discharge cycles. But the Stanford battery was able to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity. This was the first time an ultra-fast aluminum-ion battery was constructed with stability over thousands of cycles. By comparison, a typical lithium-ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles. Another feature of the aluminum battery is flexibility.  You can bend it and fold it, so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices. Aluminum is also a cheaper metal than lithium. In addition to small electronic devices, aluminium batteries could be used to store renewable energy on the electrical grid.

It had been four years since he'd graduated from high school with hopes of attending a four-year college. But year after year, at school after school, his applications were rejected. Four years on, just as his high school friends were preparing to graduate from college, their whole lives seemingly ahead of them, Casas was languishing. ""They were like, 'But you were such a good student in high school,'"" Casas remembers his friends saying. The truth was, Casas knew why he couldn't get into school, but he also knew he couldn't tell his friends. To tell anyone the truth--that he was an undocumented immigrant, a secret he kept for 13 long years--was to risk being taken away from his family, his friends, and the only home he'd known since his parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was 8. Related Stories Even Conservatives Say Trump's Immigration Plan Is Dystopian Zuckerberg-backed Site: Immigration Stance Could Doom GOP Tech Giants Back Immigrants In Upcoming Supreme Court Fight ""I got really sad and depressed,"" he says. ""You stop thinking of yourself as a human being, and you start thinking of yourself as a number."" The second time Casas considered suicide was last February after a Texas court blocked President Obama's expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama's executive order would have allowed people like Casas who came to the US as children to get a work permit and exemption from deportation. Casas was now 35, and thanks to the kindness of one admissions officer, he had eventually received a bachelor's degree and MBA from the University of Maryland. Still, without a work permit, the only job Casas could find, even with his degrees, was as a personal trainer. DACA, he believed, would be his ticket to the career he'd worked so long and hard for. ""Once DACA got shut down I was like, 'I'm out of options. There's nothing left,"" Casas says. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. It was risky, Casas knew, but it wasn't unheard of. Starting in 2010, an intrepid group of young undocumented immigrants in Chicago launched the Coming Out of the Shadows campaign. They uploaded videos to YouTube, telling the world that they were undocumented. Since then, thousands more videos have landed on YouTube. Undocumented people have created page after page on Facebook. They've used the hashtag #UndocumentedandUnafraid to band together and share their stories on Twitter. And advocacy groups like Define American have sprouted up with the explicit purpose of getting undocumented people and their allies to reshape their own narrative using the tools of the Internet. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. Casas decided it was time to join this movement. So he reached out to Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and founder of Define American. Vargas came out as undocumented in the pages of The New York Times Magazine in 2011 and in the process became perhaps the most public face of the undocumented community. Like Casas, Vargas knows all too well what it's like to carry the weight of isolation for so long. He had never even met another undocumented person his age until he was 28. ""I found out I was undocumented in 1997, and it was like, you couldn't Google it,"" Vargas says. ""There was no social networking to be done. So it just goes inside of you. You internalize it. It eats you up and grows into this kind of tumor in a way."" It's no wonder, then, that mounting research is finding that undocumented youths and the children of undocumented immigrants often suffer, like Casas, with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. But the connective powers--and relative anonymity--of the Internet are starting to break down these walls of secrecy, finally enabling undocumented people to find each other and remind each other that they're not as alone as they think they are. ""I would argue this is the first civil rights movement that has grown up in social media,"" says Vargas, who launched Define American's Coming Out campaign last summer. Telling the World Just as important as telling these stories to one another is sharing these stories with the world, say members of the coming-out movement. That's particularly true in an election cycle in which presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has tried to cast undocumented immigrants as a blight on the country. Trump has famously promised to deport the estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a threat one might expect would dissuade people like Casas from coming out. Instead, he says, it's motivated him. ""I thought, what if I told the world: 'Hey America, this is what an undocumented immigrant looks like, and by the way, we're not rapists,'"" Casas says. ""I'm at a point in my life where it's like, help me or deport me. Don't leave me in limbo."" The connective powers and relative anonymity of the Internet are starting to break down walls of secrecy. Casas isn't the only one who's been compelled to speak out in the era of Trump. Thomas Kim, a law student at Arizona State University, also recently reached out to Define American to discuss how he could safely come out. ""The conversation about immigration got more hostile and more harsh,"" Kim says. ""I wanted to break the stereotypes that undocumented students are lazy, and they don't speak English."" On a surface level, it seems, people like Casas, Vargas, and Kim are putting themselves at risk. And yet many have found that by speaking out, they become part of a network that can protect them in the long run. ""It's sort of like a safety network,"" says Erika Andiola, an undocumented immigrant who came to the US from Mexico when she was 11. Andiola began working as an immigrant rights organizer in 2008, after Arizona passed a law that banned undocumented immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. By 2013, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided her home in Arizona, taking her mother and brother with them, Andiola's online network was already vast. ""My first reaction was: 'I'm going to put it on YouTube and let people know,'"" Andiola remembers. ""These types of things happen everyday. Raids. Deportations, but nobody talks about it."" The Power of Sharing The video, which features a sobbing Andiola moments after the raid, received 60,000 views within 12 hours. It included a phone number for ICE that people could call to demand Andiola's family be returned to Arizona. And it worked. The following day, her family members were released, and Andiola wrote the following message on Facebook: ""My mom was on [her] way to Mexico. She said the driver turned around when she received a call. She was really confused, than they told her that the reason why she was returning was because her daughter was mobilizing the whole country to get her to come back. The reality is, you all made it happen!"" Now, as Bernie Sanders' national press secretary for Latino outreach, Andiola regularly tells that story in front of crowds of thousands. 'No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts.' Of course, not everyone's coming out story has a happy ending. Last November, in an essay published in The Huffington Post, Casas told the world he was undocumented. The next day, he wrote a lengthy Facebook post about it and later went on to upload a video of himself telling his story on YouTube. But while these messages make Casas appear defiant, he says, ""my life has gotten so much harder."" Over the last year, Casas, who is still a personal trainer, says exposing his legal status has cost him income, several clients, and a few friendships. There were the anonymous attacks, too. ""No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts,"" he says. And yet, Casas says he doesn't regret his decision to come out. ""Sharing my story and hearing how people felt about me, I gained the most incredible gift I could imagine,"" he says. Recently, he's begun volunteering with undocumented kids in his area, because he says, ""I would have killed to know someone like me when I was 18."" Still, he says there are plenty of days he considers getting in his car, driving to the border, and self-deporting. But there's one thing that stops him, he says: ""I know these kids are watching me."" Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 immigration Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

(Rumors & News & Leaks)"	"youtube.com"	"In this video, you'll find the latest rumors about the Apple Watch 2nd generation, which has a release date of April 2016 - maybe. Some of the biggest rumours include speculation about whether Apple will include a FaceTime camera in the bezel of the watch, and whether the company will include a thinner display panel to accommodate a larger battery. Web pages mentioned in this video: APPLE INSIDER: http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/07/02/rumor-apple-watch-2-will-add-bigger-battery-look-exactly-the-same- http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/21/next-apple-watch-extremely-unlikely-to-get-facetime-video-calling TECH NEWS TODAY: http://www.technewstoday.com/24800-apple-watch-2-will-not-have-major-changes-except-a-better-battery/ INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TIMES: http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apple-watch-2-facetime-camera-battery-life-price-launch-date-all-rumours-so-far-1507348 -- Please subscribe to HandyAndy Tech Tips! It would really help me out a lot. -- PARTIAL VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: Hi, it's HandyAndy Tech Tips here. Now the Apple Watch was a hotly anticipated device, and, for the most part, has been a success, with UBS analyst Steven Milunovich predicting that 31 million units will be sold in the first year of its availability. But it does have a few problems, with one of these being battery life. Many Apple Watch owners have been complaining that the device needs to be charged every day, and now it looks like Apple is set to address these concerns. According to Apple Insider, Apple is working with LG and Samsung to create a thinner display panel for the next version of the watch, which has been dubbed the ""Apple Watch 2"". The thinner display will allow the company to put a larger battery in the watch without changing its design. To other rumours, and the next-gen Apple Watch will reportedly retain the same screen resolution and size as the original model, and will not have a round display like some Android Wear smartwatches. And according to technewstoday.com, it may be a standalone device, able to make calls and receive notifications without an iPhone, which would be pretty cool. But there are some arguments about the most exciting potential feature in the second-gen Apple Watch: a FaceTime camera. Just one week ago, the International Business Times were speculating that Apple may include a front-facing camera to make video calls. Then Apple Insider claimed that the watch was extremely unlikely to get FaceTime video calling. They said that packing a camera into the bezel would be a major engineering feat because the components inside the watch are packed very densely and there might not be enough space inside the case to include a camera, and the bezel of the current-gen Watch is curved at the edge, and, if a camera was placed underneath it, severe distortions of the resulting image would occur. So maybe you can forget about making FaceTime calls, but who knows? Apple might just introduce them, and make the Dick Tracys of the world very happy indeed. So that's about all the tech world currently knows about the second gen Apple Watch. Please subscribe if you enjoyed this video.

Jared Leto's a fan and so is Jean-Michel Jarre, who sent her to live with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon. She's modeled for Diesel and composed for German theater. She's conducted magnetic resonance imaging studies on mutated HIV cells and had paintings featured in galleries in New York. She taught herself the piano at age 10. At 15, she successfully petitioned the Los Angeles courts to be home-schooled; one year later, she enrolled at the University of Maryland. Her upcoming album incorporates the synthesized sounds of actual stars, physics themes and pitch-shifting conspiracies linked to Bob Marley and Hitler. Her list of professional accomplishments puts other so-called pop culture multihyphenates to shame. She is Simonne Jones, and you will know her name. Gravity, her forthcoming EP (due out May 27th on Universal Germany) and moody first single, explores a familiar theme: the push and pull of an irresistible lover. But this being a Simonne Jones' joint, that heartache is wrapped in a blanket of industrial beats and physics-based metaphor. ""You've set me in motion / The stars are blurs around the sun / The push and pull, the force of your body / Closer you get, I'm overcome / Bound by attraction / Floating on axis / Around your atlas / You're holding me like gravity, all around."" In less skilled hands, this scientific approach to lyrical matters of the heart could've come off as ham-handed, and run the risk of alienating listeners from the song's emotional content by shoehorning it within dense concepts. Yet, it succeeds, lending to the seductive timbre of Jones' soft voice, because this is how her mind works. As her resume can attest, Jones is equal parts creative and analytical; right- and left-brained. ""The problem-solving processes around math and music are really similar in terms of pattern recognition and the type of out of the box thinking,"" says Jones, 29, speaking to me over Skype from her adopted home of Berlin. ""And for me, I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science ... and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science. It's like why are we exploring the unknown and why are we looking for patterns in the universe to make predictions and what it all means. And when you like art, thinking really hard about that, it becomes this creative process."" Image credit: Till Janz Though it's tempting to believe all pop stars-in-the-making are contrivances borne of the music industry, Jones' tendency to wax philosophical is not a calculated quirk designed to make her more marketable. Nor is her scientific knowledge base merely some gimmick she leverages for dramatic effect. In fact, it pervades her forthcoming EP. One song in particular, Spooky Action, is inspired by Einstein's theory of quantum entanglement. ""It's the most romantic idea in the whole world,"" says Jones. ""That you have two particles and they're combined on the nuclear level. And you get separated, even if it's by an entire universe. But mysteriously and instantaneously, whatever you do to one, will happen to the other. They remain connected forever. I love that idea."" Given the themes threading through her work, it's clear that Jones, whose own life has defied convention and been guided by extraordinary serendipity, is enamoured with and inspired by the greater mysteries surrounding our universe. Take, for example, the conspiracy theory Jones latched onto and, alongside producer Liam Howe, experimented with in the creation of many of Gravity's tracks: pitch shifting to 432Hz. In the Western musical scale, the note 'A' above middle 'C' is designated as 440Hz, an arbitrary standard set by the International Organization for Standardization in the mid-1950s. But that frequency, so the conspiracy theory goes, is unharmonious to the human body and environment -- and it's rumored that Hitler even used this as a means to provoke feelings of anger and aggression by playing it for crowds during his speeches. Tuning to 432Hz, however, supposedly makes for a more natural and comforting sound. Bob Marley, Beethoven and Prince are said to have dabbled with composing works tuned at 432Hz, though no concrete evidence of this exists. ""432Hz... it just feels more therapeutic and just relaxing, calm. And then that 440Hz is a little bit more tension. It doesn't ride into you like a summer wave,"" says Jones. Born in Hollywood and raised around LA, Jones, who has mostly Cherokee and Caribbean roots along with Italian, French and Irish ancestry, is an entirely self-made creature. She does not come from a musical background and, her recent Peaches tutelage excepted, owes her virtuosity to a well-trained ear and the sort of color-coded, teach yourself to play books found in the library. At age 11, Jones quickly progressed from playing very basic songs on the piano to mastering Beethoven and Chopin, writing her own compositions, and developing an appreciation for classical music along the way. As if that musical rearing wasn't prodigious enough, Jones leapfrogged past her peers in high school, successfully petitioning the courts to be homeschooled at age 15; a fast track that led to early college admission at the University of Maryland. It was there that she solidified her foothold in the worlds of art and science with a double major in biomedical research and visual arts and a double minor in biology and art history. That education led to a brief stint at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a biomedical engineering lab based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. But as with most of Jones' career twists and turns, fate intervened to indulge her artistic leanings: In 2012, having left Baltimore to pursue music in LA, Jones got a call from Peaches asking her to sub for a tech that had fallen ill. Soon after, she found herself touring Europe and trading LA's celebrity-adjacent glitz for Berlin's hipsterized Bohemia. ""I like to say that she threw me in a sack and kidnapped me and brought me to Berlin,"" says Jones. ""She's been like a really influential mentor keeping me from signing bad contracts."" Image credit: Yamaha Synths More than that, Jones credits Peaches for encouraging her to ditch modeling, which she'd undertaken on and off since the age of 16, and pursue music production. ""She kind of locked me in her studio and made me make beats and play on her analog synthesizers and get on her drum machines."" With Peaches as her guardian angel and Berlin's DIY music scene as her backdrop, Jones began merging her creative inclinations with that of technology and science, eventually securing an artist residency at Platoon Kunsthalle. ""I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science."" Simonne Jones ""I had no idea how to do this when I started,"" says Jones. ""But I'm like, okay, I'm a really good researcher and I'm going to figure this out. Everything is on the internet. ... Then it just exploded into this thing where I built midi controllers and synthesizers, and on / off switches. ... And then really building complex loop machines that were highly customized. And then I did this art installation in Berlin that was about different topics in physics and creating a little painting LED universe about the Big Bang all the way to thermodynamic laws. And then it just became this explosion of I guess just who I am -- this mashup of both worlds."" A stint modeling and performing at a Diesel runway show led to more gigs at various fashion events and art galleries, all of which culminated in Jones landing the cover of Germany's feminist-focused Missy Magazine. It was an achievement that, while it opened the door to many new opportunities, baffled Jones considering she hadn't released any music. ""You couldn't even find a song of mine on Spotify, or Soundcloud or iTunes, or anything like that. So it kind of like was the running joke: You haven't released any material and you're boring,"" she says of that early press attention. Image credit: Robin Thomson But it was precisely thanks to that bevy of premature coverage that Jones caught famed French composer and electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre's attention. Jarre, who at the time was partnering with UNESCO on a documentary designed to follow four artists to four different countries, had read an interview with Jones on music software production company Ableton's site, and selected her as one of the four. ""I was like, I'm going to Brazil and then talk to an indigenous tribe there. I want to go and live with them and sleep in the jungle in one of their jungle huts. And that was a really intense experience,"" she says of the Amazonian visit that saw her inducted into the Guarani tribe via a sacred music ritual. While there, Jones busied herself with recording ambient sounds, which were then turned into a ""Simonne Jones"" drum kit plug-in created by Native Instruments. Her musical meanderings -- which included a job composing music for the play Jedermann (Everyman in English) at the Thalia theatre and a gig opening for the Italian leg of Thirty Seconds to Mars' tour (better known as Jared Leto's band) -- eventually snagged her a recording contract with Universal Germany. She's since recorded with a wishlist of producers who've worked with the likes of Madonna, Adele, Florence Welch, RuPaul, Lana del Rey, Esthero, Kelis and Bat for Lashes. Image credit: Platoon Kunsthalle Of that bunch of producers, Jones seems to have formed a close bond with Howe, better known as one of the founding members of mid-90s trip hop band Sneaker Pimps. It was Howe who alerted Jones to the existence of recorded star frequencies, carried out by an observatory in Paris, and suggested she use them in the production of her debut album. After Howe successfully obtained the samples from a UK-based researcher, Jones began experimenting with these cosmic sounds. She describes the net effect as ""pads that are barely visible and very subliminal underneath the tracks, but definitely add this layer of atmosphere that's really spooky and kind of weird."" ""They sound like if a star could hum,"" she says. Ultimately, listeners will have to decide for themselves whether that celestial presence, in combination with the 432Hz frequency change, has any subtle effect on how positively they perceive the music on Jones' EP. But, regardless, it's further evidence of how she's striving to unite the seemingly disparate worlds of art and science that intermingle within her, rather than merely crafting an earworm song of the summer pop hook we'll be glad to forget come fall."

Instead, the world will have to wait until August to play developer Hello Games' ultra ambitious space-exploration game. Writing on the PlayStation Blog, lead developer Sean Murray says that the game will now launch this August 9th domestically and August 12th in the UK. The reason? He says a few bits weren't up to snuff. ""We understand that this news is disappointing,"" he writes. ""Making this game is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but we are so close now, and we're prepared to make the tough choices to get it right. Originally announced back in 2013, No Man's Sky only got a firm release date a couple of months ago. But the June 21st promise couldn't be kept. If you don't know anything about the game, it's a PlayStation 4 and PC title that allows players to explore a giant, procedurally generated universe. You'll be able to fly around roughly eighteen quintillion (that's a lot) planets, and disembark from your ship to explore each, cataloguing flora and fauna and completing challenges along the way. It's being made by Hello Games, a small UK-based developer previously known for the Joe Danger stunt games.

The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology[1][2] referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[3] Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, microfabrication, etc.[4] The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials,[5] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OU3YUhl1q7U/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/OU3YUhl1q7U"	"574c3003d48d0833e6740d27"	"ASUS' latest Transformers take heavy cues from Microsoft's Surface Engadget Engadget save share save share save share save share save share save share"	"Engadget"	"ASUS has just unveiled a line of new Transformer 2-in-1 PCs that look suspiciously like a certain product from Microsoft. With their touchscreens, kickstands (well, two of them have one at least) and portable keyboards, they do remind us a lot of, you guessed it, the Surface series of tablet PCs. And, of course, they all run Windows 10, which makes the Surface connection even more undeniable. Of the new announcements, the Transformer 3 Pro is the most advanced of the lot, the Transformer 3 sits somewhere in the middle, while the Mini is the lightest (and cutest). Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro and Transformer 3 launch event | 20 Photos 20 +16  Both the Transformer 3 Pro and the Transformer 3 have a 12.6-inch display with a 2880 x 1920 resolution, 275 ppi pixel density and wide viewing angles. There are other similarities as well: Both feature USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 connections, Harmon Kardon speakers, and USB 3.0 and HDMI ports. As you might expect, both 2-in-1s are also compatible with ASUS accessories such as the Pen, a Universal Dock, an AudioPod (a quad speaker with surround sound) and the ROG XG Station 2, a graphics dock that gives the humble tablet PC the power of a desktop computer (and it's VR-ready to boot!). Both tablets are available in Icicle Gold as well as Glacier Gray. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro press shots | 4 Photos 4 +1 Of the two, the Transformer 3 Pro is the heftier one at 8.35mm thick. Its kickstand has a ""stepless hinge"" that lets you set the device at any viewing angle up to 170 degrees. The 3 Pro also comes with a Cover Keyboard that's backlit and offers ""laptop-grade 1.4mm key travel"" which ASUS says will provide a typing experience similar to that of a normal-sized notebook. It also boasts an Intel Core i7 processor and up to 1TB PCIe x4 SSD and 16GB of 2133MHz RAM. It has a 13-megapixel rear camera plus a front-facing one as well. The Transformer 3 Pro uses its camera for facial recognition thanks to Windows Hello. After a brief hands-on time with the 3 Pro, I can see why this is being billed as the more ""professional"" of ASUS' new 2-in-1 PCs. It has a really sharp design and its all-metal chassis gives it a polished look. The keyboard snaps on magnetically and its chiclet keys felt pretty good when touch-typing at my usual rapid clip. I'm also a big fan of that ""stepless"" Smart Hinge, which felt pretty solid at almost every angle I could put it in. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 Pro hands-on | 7 Photos 7 +3 While the Transformer 3 has the same display size as the Transformer 3 Pro, the 3 is thinner and lighter with a thickness and weight of 6.9mm and 695 grams respectively. The Transformer 3 features a 7th generation Intel Core processor plus up to 512GB SSD and up to 8GB of RAM. Unlike the Transformer 3 Pro, the Transformer 3 has a built-in fingerprint reader on the side. It ships with a Transformer Sleeve Keyboard, also with 1.4mm of key travel and is available in the same four colors as the Cover Keyboard (Stone, Charcoal, Taupe, and Amber). The 3 doesn't have a kickstand on its own -- in fact, it looks like a regular ol' tablet without the keyboard. If the Transformer 3 Pro is a Surface clone, the 3 is more of an iPad. That aforementioned Sleeve Keyboard essentially acts as the Transformer 3's display stand. It works much the same way as the Smart Covers for the iPad, in that it only has two positions; there's no stepless Smart Hinge here. Still, aside from that, its keys have the same clicky feel as the Pro 3's Cover Keyboard. I was pleasantly surprised by this, as I was expecting it to have squishy keys like the Surface's Touch Cover. Gallery: ASUS Transformer 3 press shots | 4 Photos 4 +1 If you think both of these tablets are just too big for your tastes, ASUS also offers the Transformer Mini. It has a 10.1-inch display, is 8.2mm thin and weighs 790 grams with the keyboard attached and 530 grams without. Like the Transformer Pro 3, it also has an integrated kickstand with that stepless smart hinge design that lets you view it at any angle you like. It too has a built-in fingerprint reader, though it's located on the rear instead of the side. Gallery: ASUS Transformer Mini press shots | 3 Photos 3 +1 The keyboard is a little smaller with 1.5mm key travel but it does have an integrated palm rest like the others. I found it a little less intuitive to type using the smaller keyboard, with my fingers landing on the wrong key every so often. My guess is that I would probably figure it out over time, but I'll have to try it for a few days to see. Other features include a ZenSync smartphone integration that lets you sync up your text messages much in the same way you can with iOS and OS X El Capitan. The Transformer Mini is powered by a quad-core Intel Atom X5 processor and promises up to 11 hours of battery life. The Transformer Mini and keyboard will ship in a variety of different colors such as Quartz Gray, Pearl White, Amber, Mint Green and Icicle Gold. Pricing for the ASUS Transformer 3 Pro starts at $999 while the Transformer 3 will start at $799. The Transformer Mini will start at around $349. No word on availability just yet, but we'll update you when we know."

Retail analysts have speculated the U.S. company is gearing up for a launch of Amazon Fresh in Britain next year. The new ""Amazon Pantry"" service offers Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee of 79 pounds, the choice of more than 4,000 ""everyday essentials, in everyday sizes"", including major brands of food and drink, household supplies, baby, child and pet care, health and beauty. Members can fill up as much of a 20 kg Amazon Pantry box as they wish for one-day delivery, with a 2.99 pound fee for the first box and 99 pence for each additional box in the same order. ""Amazon Pantry has been designed to take the heavy lifting out of replenishing the often bulky basics and store cupboard essentials that people need every day,"" Amazon Pantry manager at Amazon UK, Helene Parthenay, said. Amazon Pantry is already available in the United States, Germany and Japan. All of Britain's big four supermarkets - market leader Tesco, Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - have seen sales and profits hit as they cut prices to stem the flow of shoppers to German discounters Aldi and Lidl. All of the so called big four have online grocery offers, with Morrisons the last to enter the market through a tie-up with Ocado."

BUONAMICI via Getty Images Sorry, University of New South Wales: Your efforts at shattering the efficiency record for solar cells earlier this month have been, ahem, eclipsed. A group of researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a way to possibly break the maximum efficiency of a solar cell, the Shockley-Queisser Limit. The Shockley-Queisser tops off at around 32 percent, but that's taking standard solar cell setups into account. The MIT scientists switched it up and converted incoming sunlight to heat prior to having it generate electricity, a trick that could possibly double the power produced by a given panel. These solar thermophotovoltaics (above) take light and pass it through an intermediary part comprised of nanophotonic crystals that outputs thermal radiation -- something that's otherwise wasted using typical means. From there, the radiation is converted to the best-possible light wavelengths, via an optical filter, that a normal solar cell can use. The school says this method means that in the future, passing clouds or even total darkness (if a thermal storage system is in place) wouldn't affect the system's ability to gather and produce solar energy, respectively. And this is all with what the team refers to as ""unoptimized geometry."" Meaning, efficiency could go even higher than what was achieved during this experiment. Your day in the sun is over, UNSW."

They deserve far more credit than they're getting, but there's no denying that they've never fully escaped deep nerd territory. That, our friends, is what you call a branding problem. And from the looks of it, X-Men: Apocalypse hasn't solved it. Coming in at $80 million domestically (modest for a holiday weekend, especially compared to Days of Future Past's $110.5 million opening weekend), it's no juggernaut. Sure, it took the top spot, but its competition was the unasked-for and the ridiculous: Alice Through the Looking Glass and Angry Birds. So, as we've done before with other blockbusters, we dug around the Internet to track the successes and failures of Apocalypse's marketing campaign. It's got all the right moves--nostalgia, ""accessible"" stars, app-based stunts--but it falls a little short of having that spark. And once the box-office projections came in, things got a little...awkward. Going Retro Admittedly, things start out kinda sweet. Apocalypse's '80s vibes have been fun from the beginning, and the marketing campaign has embraced and made the most of that throwback nostalgia. To wit: this kitschy, lo-res fake commercial for Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, starring Jubilee (Lana Condor): Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is now open for enrollment! #XMenApocalypsehttps://t.co/B3KSNPz05A -- X-Men Movies (@XMenMovies) May 19, 2016 Or this fake ad for an episode of In the Footsteps of ... (a parody of Leonard Nimoy's old mystery show, In Search Of ...) about En Sabah Nur (Apocalypse). (Which they followed up with a series of tweets linking Apocalypse to major historical disasters.)

Getting with the Kids But you know who doesn't get nostalgic about the '80s? People who weren't alive in the '80s. So while it escapes that Batman v. Superman stodginess, the X-Men franchise still doesn't feel entirely of-the-moment. So it's not a surprise that big portions of their marketing campaign feel distinctly youngs-friendly. Like these custom emoji--which apparently are something no superhero movie can go without these days.

Absolutely not. Is it inoffensive and fine? Sure. Despite starring Internet darling Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: Apocalypse has a bit of a star power problem--at least where social is concerned. J-Law shines on late-night TV (and rakes in next-day YouTube views), but she hasn't done much more than that, and she's pretty clearly on her way out of the franchise. In the age of personality-driven viral marketing, Shipp and Turner and Hoult are too unfamiliar to rest a campaign on. If you want evidence, just check the total retweets and favorites that the above tweets--then compare that to this single, banal Hugh Jackman tweet.

While the standalone X-Men Movies app was basically a clunkier, X-centric Instagram, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to finish what Deadpool's Tinder account started. The Apocalypse marketing team bought out Snapchats's lenses for a day, and replaced them with ones that literally turned Snapchat users into X-Men. TK PHOTOS Not everyone was happy that it was now mandatory for them to become X-Men rather than a cute dog and someone puking a rainbow, but this was actually legitimately cool. (Snapchat also debuted a new feature where you could buy X-Men: Apocalypse tickets in-app.) So: points for effort and creativity, but demerits for the fact that the movie tried to make us put its faces on our faces. Which is maybe the most 2016 thing we've written in some time. The (Defensive) Aftermath Maybe because things never quite clicked with the whole viral marketing thing, publicity efforts seem to have taken a sharp right. For a number of days now, the movie's official Twitter account has been a retweet machine, and the message they're trying to drive home is pretty unambiguous. #XMenApocalypse was better than some of the harshest reviews suggest. Some great scenes honouring the comics heritage. Good fun. -- Sir Jay Brane-Jarr (@thebraininajar) May 26, 2016 Don't agree with all the bad reviews of #XMenApocalypse .

Calm down, and listen to Liz Lemon: Regardless of critical response, the X-Men are always going to have a place in our hearts, in nerd culture, and in the multiplex. It's just maybe not going to be right there alongside Batman or the Avengers. Embrace your nature, X-Men promotional campaign engineers: There's so much more to you than you know. Go Back to Top.

Now, the famous futurist has finally revealed one of the projects his team has been working on: chatbots that can talk like humans do. He lifted the veil on the big G's chatbot initiative at the latest Singularity conference -- an annual conference on science, tech and the future. Although Kurzweil didn't spill a lot of details, he did say that one of those chatbots is named Danielle. Since it's based on a character he wrote for one of his unpublished novels, we're guessing they're feeding it samples of his writing to give it the personality he envisions. The futurist is known for his prediction that AIs will pass the Turing test in 2029, and developing these bots is a step in that direction. Kurzweil says they're planning to release some of the chatbots they've been working on later this year. Hopefully, Google learned from Microsoft's experience, so Danielle doesn't turn out like Tay."

It triggers the appropriate response to prevent even greater injuries or even to save your life. A couple of German researchers think so too, so they're working on a way to make robots ""feel"" -- or, more accurately, to detect and respond to -- pain. That way, they can move away from anything that could damage them, thereby lengthening their lifespans and preventing the need for costly repairs. Johannes Kuehn and Professor Sami Haddadin from the Leibniz University of Hannover presented their work at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Sweden last week. In the video below, you can see them demonstrating their ""nervous robot-tissue model that is inspired by the human skin structure"" on a robotic arm. The robotic nervous system classifies pain as light, moderate (such as strong collisions) or severe (anything that can damage the machine). Each type triggers an appropriate response, as they explained in their ICRA paper: ""In the [light] pain class, such contacts occur that may harm the robot or prevent it from performing the task. The robot ""feels"" uncomfortable and shall smoothly retract until the contact event is over and return thereafter. Strong collisions are covered in the [moderate] pain class. The robot ""feels"" moderate pain, shall quickly retract, and more distant until the contact event is over. Then, it may move back. The [severe] pain class covers all contacts in which the robot may be damaged and thus needs some sort of ""help."" In order to prevent making the damage worse, the robot switches to gravity compensation with additional damping for dissipation, improving the safety of the robot and the environment by its strictly passive behavior. While the research could lead to more human-like robots than ever, it could also benefit other types of machines. The ability to feel pain could, for instance, help protect industrial machines used in factories."

Perhaps you'd like to stay in and do some binge-watching? Netflix has plenty to help you with that impulse. From six hours of awesome dino action to a whole new season of the massively addicting Orange Is the New Black, there's quite a bit coming to the streaming service this month to fill the days. Here's the programming you should prioritize this June. June 1 Jurassic Park (1993)/ The Lost World (1997) / Jurassic Park III (2001) This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!) But the the three original Jurassic movies are a fine Plan B in the absence of prehistoric thrills at the cineplex. All together, it's around six hours of (mostly) amazing dinosaur action. Say goodbye to a Saturday. This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!) But the the three original Jurassic movies are a fine Plan B in the absence of prehistoric thrills at the cineplex. All together, it's around six hours of (mostly) amazing dinosaur action. Say goodbye to a Saturday. June 10 Voltron: Legendary Defender (2016) The reboots of cartoons from the 1980s continues with Netflix's Voltron. The original series was about five young pilots who find flying lion robots and combine them into one giant warrior. In the new show, five students at a flight academy stumble upon one of the lions, and get whisked away to become a team and defend the universe. Get excited, cartoon fans.

June 17 Orange Is The New Black, Season 4 (2016) Jenji Kohan's Netflix Original has come a long way from the early days of Piper Chapman at Litchfield Penitentiary, adding in backstories for many different inmates along the way. The fourth season will continue last year's for-profit prison storyline as Litchfield adds more guards, restricts the inmates even further, and sees tensions ratchet up to new levels.

June 22 Spotlight (2015) This year's Oscar winner for Best Picture, about the Boston Globe journalists who uncovered a long history of abuse within the Catholic Church, is by no means a flashy movie, but it's persistent and picks its moments of stylistic emphasis carefully. It's the latest film to carry on the legacy of All The President's Men and Zodiac, illuminating the people who put in hours of hard work to bring stories to the public.

June 24 The Fundamentals of Caring (2016) Fundamentals stars Paul Rudd as a grieving father who takes a job as the caregiver for a teenager with a rare disease. They embark on a road trip to see tourist traps, and along the way connect with a foul-mouthed runaway. If that sounds like a movie made from the spare parts of a million Sundance films, it is.

Aside from prohibiting murder, there are essentially no rules.

It's not designed to help you."" The president sounded at turns exasperated and confounded as he addressed the people of Elkhart, Indiana, a town he last visited during the throes of the recession in 2009, and which he said he chose today ""precisely because this county votes Republican."" ""If the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you who will have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class,"" Obama told the crowd before laying out what he believes the differences between those visions are. For Obama, the speech was a chance to boast about his administration's economic achievements--including the country's consistent job growth and a shrinking deficit--while bashing the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who Obama believes would derail that progress. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama took Trump to task over everything from his tax policies to immigration to trade to his ""provocative"" tweets. ""I'm not here looking for votes,"" Obama said. ""I'm here because I care deeply as a citizen about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over the last seven and a half years."" Populist POTUS Not that Obama shied away from sounding the kind of populist note that has characterized the 2016 campaign season. He called Trump's proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants ""a fantasy"" and rejected the idea that immigrants are responsible for stagnating wages in this country. Instead, he laid the blame on another popular target--corporate elites. ""Those decisions are made in the board rooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker,"" he said. He went on to frame Trump as a candidate who only has the interests of the rich at heart. He attacked Trump's plans to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, and lambasting his proposed tax plan which would provide a major tax cut to the top .1 percent of American earners. ""That will not make your lives better,"" Obama said. ""That will help people like him."" Trade-offs On trade, Obama called the idea that ""other countries are killing us on trade,"" which is a frequent Trump talking point, a myth. He argued, instead, that while trade and technological advancement have hurt certain industries, they've helped others, like agriculture and technology. He also emphasized the importance of trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership in dictating the terms of trade. ""If you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century, and they're trying, then TPP makes sure we set the rules,"" Obama said. On that point, at least, Obama was not just fighting Trump's anti-trade rhetoric. Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have publicly opposed the deal as well. With that exception, the president's talk could have easily been ripped from the stump speeches of either of the Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. On nearly every economic issue--from pay equity to labor standards to investment in infrastructure--Obama painted a doomsday scenario on the right. ""When I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention,"" Obama said. ""If we fall for a bunch of okey doke, just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.""

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Donald Trump election 2016 President Barack Obama This weekend's Nevada Democratic State Convention looked like something out of a Donald Trump rally--which is to say, it was marked by chaotic protests, violent threats, and flying projectiles. On Saturday night, Bernie Sanders' supporters reportedly revolted against the Nevada Democratic Party, accusing it of intentionally rigging the convention to favor Hillary Clinton. The fight continued throughout the weekend as aggrieved Sanders supporters deluged Nevada Democratic Chair Roberta Lange with sexist and threatening texts and voicemails. Today, the Vermont senator issued a statement condemning any instances of violence carried out by his supporters. At the same time, he denounced what he called a corrupt system within the Nevada state party. ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,"" Sanders said in a statement. But, he added: ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" At issue is the fact that though Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign has been actively organizing to win county conventions. By amassing more delegates at these county conventions, the Sanders campaign stood to cut into Clinton's delegate lead at the statewide convention. But the Nevada State Democratic Party denied credentials to 64 of Sanders' delegates, saying that they either weren't registered as Democrats or that their records couldn't be verified. In the end, six of them received credentials, but the vote still tipped in Clinton's favor. The room soon erupted in protests. Meanwhile, the chaotic scene has created waves within Sanders' massive Reddit community as well. Moderators are urging Sanders supporters to avoid the kind of language that could get them in trouble with the media. ""They're  expecting  us to act this way. If we take the bait and react violently and/or with threats of violence, we play right into their hands,"" one moderator wrote. ""Remember, what would Bernie do?"" Setting aside the issue of violence, however, it's a little ironic to see the Sanders campaign accusing the state party of rigging the contest. Sanders has often criticized party leaders for trying to subvert the will of the people. But in this case, it's Clinton who won the Nevada caucus to begin with and Sanders who's using the cryptic system of delegate math to gain the edge.

RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it anymore. Last night, in a Tweetstorm for the ages, the Florida Senator let loose a torrent of frustrations about what has been the most absurd election cycle in recent memory. And can you blame him? It's been a rough year for Rubio. Once thought to be the Republican party's great hope, instead he spent this election cycle being repeatedly ridiculed for his height, his urge to stay well hydrated, his possibly overactive sweat glands, and more. He not only lost his home state of Florida, but he opted not to run for re-election to the Senate. With the exception of his Marcorobot meltdown during the New Hampshire debate, the young Senator mostly retained his composure. But with just months left until he's a private citizen again, Rubio is taking a note straight from the Donald Trump playbook, and telling it like it is on Twitter. The flint to Rubio's fire last night seemed to have been a Washington Post article alleging that he is ""betwixt and between"" on his next move.

It's just what he does. But how difficult would this actually be? Yes, I know Captain America is just a comic book hero, but that doesn't mean this won't be a fun physics problem. How do you model a thrown shield reflecting off different surfaces? Really, that's the difficult part. Let me go ahead and start with some assumptions. The speed of the shield doesn't matter. I will assume it ""flies"" like an airplane wing so it will follow a level trajectory and not drop as it travels. In the comic books, the shield is made from vibranium. Let's assume this allows perfectly elastic collisions with different surfaces. As I showed before, a completely elastic collision can obey the ""law of reflection"". This means that when the shield hits a wall, the angle of incidence will be equal to the angle of reflection. I think that's enough to start making a model. It's not difficult to make a shield move at a constant speed, but the reflection off a wall isn't so straightforward. Here's three questions you have to ask: Does the shield even hit the wall? When and where is the collision with the wall? What is the reflected velocity vector given the orientation of the wall and the incoming velocity? Yes, it would be fairly easy to model this in the case of a wall that is only in the y-direction (up/down), but I want a more generic reflection. First, how do we know if there is a collision? There are several methods for collision detection (it's an important part of many video games) but I want to create my own. Suppose I have a wall with a length of L, oriented in some direction, and a shield moving toward it. The first thing I am going to do is to find the position of the two end points for the wall (P1 and P2). Now I can calculate the distance from P1 and P2 to the position of the shield. If the shield is intersecting this wall, the sum of these distances should equal L. Here is a diagram: If I calculate these distances as vectors, the sum of the magnitudes of r1 and r2 (from P1 and P2 to the shield) will only equal L if the center of the shield is between the two points. If the shield is outside the points or not yet to the wall, their sum will exceed L. A couple of things to notice. First, I am just dealing with this wall in 2-D, but this method should work in 3-D. Second, I don't care about the size of the shield--I am merely dealing with it as a point object. I don't think this matters for playing with collisions with a wall (we could change this later if it bothers you). Now for the reflection. This is trickier and my method only works in 2-D so the shield moves in the x-y plane. If I create a wall in VPython (Glowscript), there are some properties of this object which is technically a ""box."" There is the position of the center of the box, the size of the box and the ""axis."" The axis is a vector that is perpendicular to the box to describe its orientation. Here is a diagram showing the shield colliding with the wall. The two important vectors are the velocity and the axis. Here I have a as the angle between the incident velocity vector and the axis vector. You can find this angle by first finding the dot product between these two vectors and using the following relationship: Finding the dot product for vectors is simple if you know the vector in component form (the x,y,z components). It's also simple to find the magnitude of these vectors. So, in the end you get the angle between these two vectors. Oh, it's even easier since both the dot product (dot) and the vector magnitude (mag) are built in functions in VPython. But what I really need is the angle th which shows the amount I would have to rotate the original vector. Based on my drawing, this vector th would be: Now that I have the rotation angle, I need to rotate the vector. I can use the rotation matrix in 2-D. Here is the xkcd version of the rotation matrix. It's funnier than the actual matrix. So, that's pretty simple. Now let's put it all together. Actually, this is sort of like a video game. So I made a video game. Just drag the arrow to pick the direction you wish to aim the shield. The goal is to bounce the shield off the wall and hit the blue circle. If you successfully hit the circle, it turns yellow. If you miss, just press play and try again. The code is a little messy--but you can check it out here. I'll probably make a screencast in which I go over the different parts of this program. Once you play with this program, you might notice it's not so trivial to aim at the wall and hit the target. You can do it, but only with a little bit of guesswork. How about something a bit more complicated? What if the reflected surface isn't a flat wall but a curved surface? In this case we can still assume that the incident and reflected angle are still equal. However, there is a big difference. Now if you hit the curved surface at a slightly different point, it will have a different axis about which it will reflect. In terms of coding, it's actually an easier program to create. Collision detection is simpler. All I need to do is determine the distance from the center of the curved wall to the center of the shield. If this distance is less than the sum of their radii, then they ""hit."" After that, I merely need to calculate the vector that is equivalent to the axis vector for the wall. There is one problem that I encountered--depending on where the shield hits, it could reflect either to the left or the right. By finding the angle between the incident velocity vector and the ""axis"" I can determine the direction of rotation in the rotation matrix. Here is the same ""game"" with a curved surface. (the code) Pretty tough, right? Of course Captain America is better than all of you at this. He can bounce his shield off multiple surfaces and score a ""hit."" Are you ready to try two bounces? Try to hit the curved surface and then the wall and then target. Here is the code. If you score a hit on your first try, you should be an Avenger. And if you want some homework, here are a few suggestions. Make a plot of initial velocity angle vs. deflected angle. How does this plot look for both the flat and curved wall? You might prefer to make a plot of initial angle vs. final y-position or something. What if you put in a third object to deflect the shield? Is it even solvable? Can you make the computer program find an angle that would score a hit? What about non-elastic collisions? Yes, that would be a little bit more difficult--but still fun. Go Back to Top.

Clearly, Square Enix's title is inspired by the block-building phenomenon developed by Mojang. But the two play quite differently -- Builders is a more structured adventure with clear objectives and villagers to help. The game launched on PS4, PS3 and PS Vita in January, but that was only for Japan. Today, Square Enix has confirmed it'll be coming to the West too. For now, that means a PS4 and PS Vita (digital-only) release across Europe this October. There's no word yet on a US release date, however. I played the new, localized version for roughly 30 minutes and came away pleasantly surprised. It's set after the original Dragon Quest and explores what might have happened after the so-called ""bad"" ending, where you choose not to fight the Dragonlord. The world of Alefgard is ruined and you wake up with no memories (surprise, surprise) and the power to build. Your task is to venture out into the world and teach the art of creative construction to everyone you meet, healing the land along the way. The characters, items and monsters are all Dragon Quest-themed, offsetting the blocky visuals taken from Minecraft. I enjoyed the simple quests, which served to explain the crafting system and blueprints -- unlockable patterns which you set on the ground and build on top of. Once you've laid down the necessary number of blocks, and thrown a pre-determined list of items inside, the game recognises that you've built a certain structure. Villagers can then use and inhabit them, building out your tiny empire. It won't be for everyone, but if you fall into one of two camps -- a diehard Dragon Quest fan, or someone that's been looking for a more guided and focused Minecraft experience -- this could be up your alley."

The project racked up $1.5 million during a Kickstarter campaign in 2013, but it wasn't enough to get the project off the ground. While they won't be getting a photo of themselves from space, the 17,000-plus backers will at least be getting their money back. The project was supposed to use a specially modified Arkyd 100 telescope mounted with a second camera pointed at an external screen that would display a user's picture and snap an extraterrestrial selfie. The company even promised users they could point the telescope at the backdrop of their choice (as long as it wasn't the sun) and a majority of the project's backers paid $25 for space selfie option. Another 27 contributors shelled out $10,000 for tickets to the selfie-scope's launch, which obviously isn't happening at this point. ""It's a decision that we make with a heavy heart,"" Planetary Resources CEO Chris Lewicki told GeekWire. While the crowdsourcing campaign shot past their expectations, Lewicki says his company couldn't find the right partner to turn this into a real space mission. Although the selfie-shooting satellite was a failure to launch, Planetary Resources is still preparing to put ""a constellation of Arkyd 100 telescopes"" in orbit by the end of 2019. Those satellites are designed for thermal infrared and hyperspectral Earth photography, however, so you might still technically be in the picture, but you'll be a lot harder to spot."

Despite then-commissioner David Stern's misgivings, the United States sent the Dream Team to Barcelona for the 1992 Summer Olympics, and finally the best basketball players in the world had the attention of an international audience. The superstar-laden roster is legendary--Jordan, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Johnson, Bird, Ewing, Mullin, Robinson, Barkley, Drexler (and Laettner, the only non-Hall of Famer)--and utterly dominated the tournament, where they won games by an average of 44 points. The public reception in Spain was ecstatic--coach Chuck Daly likened it to ""Elvis and The Beatles put together""--and the team's effect on the game was immediately felt. Then-IOC chair Juan Antonion Samaranch called the basketball tournament ""the most important aspect of the Games.""

But the most important step toward mass-audience international broadcasting was getting the league's games on the air in China. CCTV-China aired every game of the 1994 Finals between Houston and New York, making it the first time the country carried every game of the championship series live. It was a clear sign of rising interest in the sport. The Chinese Basketball Association began playing a year later in 1995, quickly expanded (it currently has 20 teams), and the country remains one of the most vibrant overseas professional leagues for players who don't quite make the cut in the NBA.

But the league decided to follow Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League and expand to Canada, founding the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors, making the ""National"" in its name a bit of a misnomer. Unfortunately, the Grizziles didn't last long in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, but the Raptors have held on in Toronto, making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history this season.

Satellite and cable providers carry league packages for all games, and now each league is waking up to the internet streaming model to make games available to cord-cutters. But the NBA began experimenting with putting its games online 20 years ago, when it started ""cybercasting"" games worldwide over the internet using ESPNET SportsZone. It took many years for streaming technology to be so widely available and fast that fans would demand access to games via the internet, but broadcasting internet audio in the 1990s shows an impressive amount of foresight, even as an experiment.

But that's not true for Michael Jordan, whose pioneering shoe endorsements paved the way for almost every significant player since. And it's also not true of recently-retired Kobe Bryant, who remains one of the most popular players overseas even as his career precipitously declined in the NBA. Much of that popularity can be traced back to the first international trip he took to Australia, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines before the 1998-1999 season. Since then, he's gone back an additional nine times--his 2015 Asian Summer Tour with Nike hit Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Taipei. Bryant is the model for international basketball stardom, not simply doing his work on the court during the season, but taking the time to develop an iconic persona everywhere in the world people play and watch basketball. Few players have marketed themselves individually to international fans with lucrative and enduring success quite like Bryant.

(The essential 30 For 30 installment Once Brothers traces the bond between eastern European stars Vlade Divac and Drazen Petrovic in the late 1980s and early 1990s.) But the decade after the Dream Tream saw international players emerge on a level previously unseen in the NBA. German wunderkind Dirk Nowitzki, who impressed Charles Barkley during international camps as a teenager, arrived in 1998 and by the early 2000s had begun a streak of 10 consecutive All-Star appearances. And the 2000 draft saw 14 international players selected, with seven in the first round. But seven-foot six-inch Chinese center Yao Ming, taken first overall by the Houston Rockets in 2002, is perhaps the most significant international player in the history of the NBA. While other international players had more success on the court, Yao was an unmissable icon who gave millions of Chinese fans a patriotic reason to follow the NBA. Though he only played eight (injury-shortened) seasons and made the playoffs four times in Houston, his cultural impact was so undeniable that Yao was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Allen Iverson and Shaquille O'Neal in 2016.

But since joining, the league has been by leaps and bounds the most savvy official league account with regard to engaging with fans and cultivating new ones using wide-reaching social media channels. The league doesn't just employ a hands-off approach to fans enthusiastically circulating highlights, it actively encourages users to share videos and pictures that help continue conversations about dunks, long threes, incredible passes, or controversial moments. Takedown notices are nowhere to be found. Instead, NBA Twitter is a raucous and celebratory environment where every great play can be looped millions of times, and every tragic loss gets a Crying Jordan within the hour. And that makes it the most fun sport to watch at home while following along with the conversation online.

Two cameras--one stationed courtside and another up in the rafters, beamed video to Samsung Gear VR users via the NextVR app. Front-row experiences vary by sport. It's arguably more fun to be in the stands where it's possible to catch a foul ball or a home run in baseball instead of behind the plate. And football is best viewed where it's possible to see the whole field of play. But basketball is exhilarating from up close, and because the court is small enough it's still possible to see everything going on from that vantage point. VR livestreams have expanded to other big-time sporting events (the U.S. Open) and other limited-access experiences (this year's Coachella music festival offered 360 video for its main stage), but it's entirely possible that in the foreseeable future, NBA League Pass will include some kind of provision for courtside VR viewing at a fraction of the cost of an actual ticket. And watching in VR means you're not part of the problem if your team's star player goes headfirst into the stands and nobody steps in to catch him.

That's not the full size (it'll ultimately be 7 feet long), but it's hopefully smooth sailing from here on out. You'll have to wait a while before anyone steps inside this cocoon-like pod, mind you.

Spain. These graphene polymer cells give the car a range of 1,000 kilometers These batteries triple the power of lithium ion and reduce its price by 77%. If there is something to lose sleep electric vehicle manufacturers are batteries. It is a requirement of the sector to increase its potency and duration as well as reduce load time Headaches that are about to come to an end. The production of graphene on an industrial scale, has joined the University of Cordoba for the first graphene polymer batteries. A company will be responsible for the manufacture of the cells, which have already been tested in Cordoba, starting next year. Two of the four major German automotive companies (can not yet reveal names) will begin this month to test the batteries with electric cars. Graphene, discovered in 2004 by Dr. Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester, has amazing properties. It is thin, superconducting, transparent and strong. Although it takes years promising to revolutionize the field of batteries, it was difficult to incorporate it into mass production. However, in 2012 the company, in Alicante, became the first global manufacturer of graphene on an industrial scale. From there the main effort has been focused on accelerating the actual applications called 'material god'. The latter comes as a battery. The newly developed technology incorporates graphene polymer composition. The benefits result in energy density, length, speed of load, weight and price. ""It will be a great leap forward for industries such as aerospace, automotive, computer or power supply, improving efficiency and providing opportunities that until now, could only be imagined. The new product, developed by the University of Cordoba, has a power ""far superior"" to any other technology available in the market, a fact that ""minimizes the percentage of wasted energy during use."" If lithium ion battery (the most advanced to date) has a density of 180 of graphene exceeds 600. That is, three times the power of current best technology on the market. Also gains in lifetime. Graphenano batteries are able to last up to four times longer than traditional metal hydride and two times more than lithium. For example, ""an electric vehicle with this technology could reach 1,000 km of autonomy."" And all this with a load of no more than eight minutes. Less weight and cost properties of graphene may also reduce the weight of the batteries 'half' of the conventional, ""increasing the performance and autonomy of the machines on which it is applied."" The University of Cordoba is now working to reduce the volume to an advanced version of the batteries. Graphene has ""high density"", so for now the batteries are suitable for electric vehicles (from boats to cars). In the future, the team hopes to reduce its size to incorporate into electronic devices such as mobile phones. Cost is another advantage of graphene batteries, which will manufacture and market. This product will be ""up to 77% cheaper"" than lithium, ""standing within reach of consumers from the same day they go on sale."" They will be compatible with existing devices or vehicles, avoiding an adaptation of infrastructure for use and promoting its rapid implementation. Today ""Grabat Energy"" and ""Graphenano batteries"" will be a reality."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uueLj9zXuic/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/uueLj9zXuic"

The fight between different standards and a lack of support from phone makers has made the entire idea of charging your mobile wirelessly a huge mess. Mophie is hoping to bring some sanity to the concept with its new $100 Juice Pack Wireless cases for the iPhone 6 and 6S, which integrate cord-free charging along with an additional 50 percent of battery life. Like Mophie's earlier wireless cases for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, the new iPhone cases are compatible with virtually every wireless charging standard on the market, including Qi and Powermat. They also sport integrated magnets, which keeps them attached to their included charging bases, as well as Mophie's vent mount for cars and desk mount accessories. Naturally, those mounts also serve as wireless charging surfaces. By adding in magnets, Mophie solves a problem endemic to all wireless charging solutions so far: they're often less convenient than charging with a cord, since you can't pick up your phone. Mophie's mount accessories avoids that issue entirely. More so than Samsung's recent phones, which already have wireless charging integrated, the Juice Pack Wireless cases are a boon for iPhone users who have been aching for cord-free charging. iPhone owners already need special cases if they want to take advantage of wireless charging -- Mophie's cases simply gives them the benefit of a portable battery pack as well.

During a livestream event, Bungie confirmed that, as rumored, Rise of Iron will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. All of the game's previous expansions were released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well. Rise of Iron launches on September 20, priced at $30. However, it does also require the Destiny base game, as well as The Dark Below, House of Wolves, and The Taken King. ""Rise of Iron is an exciting addition to the Destiny universe,"" Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said in a statement. ""We are continually blown away and inspired by the growing Destiny community's energy and enthusiasm."" The expansion includes new areas, including The Plaguelands and Felwinter Peak. Additionally, the Destiny starting area, The Wall, has been recreated as a new area you can revisit. Players will also find a new raid, new and updated strikes, and more patrols and public events. Multiplayer fans may be happy to learn, too, that there will be more Crucible maps and features, while Rise of Iron also adds new CG and in-game cinematics. Additionally, Rise of Iron comes with a new Light level increase (an unspecified ""significant Light increase,"" developers said) and a new ""mutated"" enemy faction of the Fallen. One of the new weapons is a ""flaming waraxe,"" which is an ""encounter-specific weapon,"" developers said. This suggests it may not be available in Crucible matches. Here is what it looks like. Activision In terms of story, here is the official description: ""Guardians must rise to the challenge to take their place as the next generation of Iron Lords. Along the way they will join forces with a legend from humanity's Golden Age to defeat a plague of unstoppable evil once and for all."" Also during the livestream event, Bungie confirmed that the fan-favorite Gjallarhorn weapon is returning for Rise of Iron. Everyone can get it by completing a mission, while people who preorder will receive a limited-edition black and silver version of the gun. Similar to past Destiny expansions, there will also be items exclusive to PlayStation players for a period of time. Bungie did not announce this content today, but said more details on this, and other things related to Rise of Iron, are coming ""at a later date."" At the end of the livestream today, Bungie teased that more details may be shared at E3 2016 next week. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Rise of Iron. Looking ahead, Bungie will release a Destiny sequel in 2017; according to a report, the game was recently rebooted."

""Our ambition is to enable robotic computing for every household,"" he said before revealing ZenBo the home robot. With the goals of ""assistance, entertainment and companionship,"" it's particularly aimed at older people. However, the most interesting feature here is the promise that the robot will connect with traditional and smart home devices: you'll be able to check who's at the door from a connected camera, and then remote-unlock the door from the robot's, er, face. Zenbo will be able to connect to lights, TVs, air conditioners -- if it talks the right languages. Gallery: ASUS Zenbo home robot announcement | 24 Photos 24 +20  The robot can roam around independently, and take directions by voice command. ZenBo's face also acts as a touchpad interface: you'll be able to place video calls, shop online, as well as stream video content, when it's not blushing. It's still early days, but ASUS says ZenBo will offer spoken reminders to its owners, like doctor appointment and medication cues. It'll also be able to send emergency messages to family members if someone falls down -- you can even take control of the robot and check the situation from ZenBo's built in camera. For kids, the robot will be able to (awkwardly, robotically) dance along to music as well as read stories aloud from its built-in library. Naturally, ASUS is promoting a Zenbo developer program, with access to the bot's SDK and more information to help birth apps -- something very important if the robot is to be a success. It will be inevitably compared to Softbank's Pepper home robot, and there's a few similarities, but if it can learn one major lesson from its taller Japanese rival, it's that it needs a reason to exist, a reason to buy. It could be those smart home tricks that make or break Zenbo. Although that $599 price tag is pretty cheap for a home robot -- that will certainly help."

That's not to say the game itself isn't any good -- in fact, it's a wonderful single- and multiplayer experience for the fantastical first-person-shooter crowd. However, the opening video is divine. It's evocative, rich and effortlessly cool, built on a base of smooth hip hop and anime-inspired, neon-coated illustrations. When I think of Battleborn, my mind is immediately saturated in the cinematic's soulful rhythm. This is a new brand of video game artistry. As a game, Battleborn doesn't feature cartoon characters; it's a fully realized 3D experience from Gearbox, the creators of Borderlands. In the same vein as Borderlands, Battleborn is highly stylized, but it looks nothing like the opening cinematic. That was on purpose. Gallery: Making the 'Battleborn' cinematic | 25 Photos 25 +21  ""I wanted to come with something fresh in a sea of CG cinematics and openers,"" Gearbox art director Scott Kester says. ""We just figured players would appreciate something a bit different. I wanted a vibe to it that was fresh, but also kind of piggybacked off the feel of Samurai Champloo's opening, with a healthy mix of Aeon Flux for good measure."" Kester was inspired by cartoons from the '80s and early '90s, and he wanted the prologue to get players pumped for the actual game. He secured the cinematic of his dreams by working with animation studio Secret Sauce and hip hop group Deltron 3030, which includes Dan the Automator (Daniel Nakamura) and Del The Funky Homosapien (Teren Jones). The cinematic's energetic animations and its mellow soundtrack balance each other perfectly; they feel as if they were produced by the same mind. In reality, they were completely separate projects. Secret Sauce CEO Sanford Greene and animation director LD Walker didn't even hear the song until their work on the animation was finished, Greene says. ""During the production of the animation we didn't have any soundtrack to go by so LD did his best to keep the shot pacing tight in the middle and open on the ends,"" he says. ""Seems it just magically worked out after Del's track was recorded and laid down."" As he wrote the lyrics for ""Countdown,"" the prologue song, Del took inspiration from Battleborn's storyline, interpreting its main points in his own way. He didn't want the track to feel like an advertisement for the game. ""I just took the subject matter of the game and I went with that, but without directly following it note for note,"" Del says. ""Tried to make it more universal in feel so it could stand outside of the game as well."" One reason these pieces came together so seamlessly was the creators' shared love of video games. Walker in particular is a fan of action role-playing titles, platformers, fighters and shoot-em-ups. Del is a huge gaming fan and he's been making music for the industry since 2000. His work has appeared in Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, a handful of Tony Hawk titles, NBA 2K5 and 2K7, Skate 3, and, more recently, Street Fighter V. ""I was a crazy player when it was the vidiot era -- '80s, you know, arcades and stuff,"" Del says. ""I used to be stuck at the arcade, I used to buy every mag.... I had every system, still have emulators of most of the classic systems with every game, I got every arcade emu for every game I ever played in the arcade -- so, uh, yeah, I'm kinda a video game fan, a little."" It also helped that Secret Sauce and Gearbox go way back. Sanford and Kester have known each other for a long time; they actually started out working together in the comics industry. Secret Sauce is a small and relatively new team, but Kester says he respects their work. Plus, working with Deltron 3030 was ""a dream"" of Kester's, partially because he's a fan of Dan the Automator and Del, and partially because this project gave him a chance to amplify their voices. Sure, Del has created music for video games, but that doesn't mean he's a household name in the gaming universe. ""Del tells such vivid sci-fi stories in his lyrics and was just a perfect fit for us,"" Kester says. ""I was specifically interested in Deltron and Secret Sauce due to the fact they aren't super widely known in the game community. I think any time you can draw more attention to different artists across different disciplines is, well, like a duty we have as creators, honestly. To expose people to new cool things."" Secret Sauce was definitely on-board with Kester's preferred animation style, too: a Japanese-inspired, anime look. ""They avoid correcting every single drawing to look perfectly homogeneous,"" Walker says. ""Instead, they let that animator cut loose and belt out the equivalent of a guitar solo."" That's what Kester wanted with the Battleborn introduction video; something raw yet intriguing to long-time FPS fans. Something different. The AAA industry is largely focused on creating realistic 3D animations, Kester notes, and he hopes the cinematic is part of video games' growth as an artistic medium. He'd love to play an entire game that looks like the prologue, for instance. ""I'm interested in seeing game art styles evolve and take us to new places visually,"" Kester says. ""We have an obsession in the gaming world to keep trying to replicate reality, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm more interested personally in making things that let me escape this world. Let's show people styles and places I could never visit in real life."" Video games are art and experiences like the Battleborn prologue help demonstrate this aspect to the wider world. Del, for his part, has always viewed games as artistic expressions. ""Maybe people just didn't believe or see it, but I did,"" Del says. ""Matter of fact, the earlier games had to have art invested in it because the graphics weren't that great."" Today, the potential for wild artistic experimentation exists within gaming, Del says, but large studios are mostly focused on creating lifelike worlds. ""I lean toward more fanciful-type games, personally,"" he says. Now that Secret Sauce has dipped its toes into the world of gaming animation, Walker and Greene are hungry for more -- and they're not just dreaming any longer. Or, as Greene puts it: ""We have plans. Let's just say that."""

The game is currently scheduled for release on both consoles and PC some point in 2017. It follows the standard RPG trope format wherein a player's neophyte character joins an organization -- in this case, the ""Absolvers"" who maintain world stability through combat -- and must advance through the ranks by clearing dungeons. You know, just like your first job out of school. The game will include both PvE and PvP arenas and offer all sorts of upgradeable/customizable gear. Everything from armor and weapons to combat styles and even individual attack sequences can be tweaked to the player's preference -- fingers crossed for a One Punch Man skin. But what really sets Absolver apart from other MMOs is its utter lack of firearms. From what you can see in the reveal trailer above, characters will have access to swords, staves and maybe even some magic but projectile weapons appear strictly verboten.

Instead, these phones all support USB Type-C digital headphones through the charging port. This means that we will have better audio quality thanks to the lossless nature of digital headphones, but it also means you'll lose the ability to listen to music when charging your phone, something many of us us do at work every single day. So while it might be nice to have fancy new USB Type-C headphones, you might also need to invest in a solid pair of Bluetooth headphones. Until the launch of LeEco's two new pairs of USB Type-C headphones - an in-ear variety and over-ear set - the JBL Reflect Aware C sports earbuds announced alongside the HTC 10 were the only USB Type-C headphones around So not only has Android become the first platform to release a device with no 3.5mm headphone port, it may be a trend that is catching on."

The JumpRoACH is a simple, two-ounce device with six crawling feet and a diamond-shaped jumping/launching mechanism powered by eight stretchy latex bands and small DC motor. While the usefulness of a robotic insect is debatable, it is definitely staying true to its source material. the major robotics breakthrough here is the robo-roach's ability to actually control the power of its tiny catapult mechanism and time its launch so it makes the jump. While the JumpRoACH (thankfully) can't fly just yet, it does have wings it can open to flip itself over onto its feet and keep on marching into your nightmares. Observe: While this is not the first robotic cockroach designed at UC Berkeley, we can all be thankful that we're not dealing with an army of actual robot zombie cockroaches."

Sure it's been done before, many times, but the Hyper Light Drifter Collector's Edition looks pretty sweet. It comes with a cyan ""SNES cartridge,"" a 24-page manual, a 24-inch by 18-inch world map poster, a box to store it all in and a digital code for the game. That manual is particularly welcome; a full-color booklet with information on enemies, drifters, and tons of beautiful artwork. The SNES cartridge is in quotes because it's just a non-functional piece of art. Also it's a North American-style SNES cartridge, so if you owned a European or Asian console, it won't look very familiar to you. As for the game... Hyper Light Drifter is really good. A lot of people have compared it to Dark Souls, but it's only similar in that it's difficult. It's a top-down 2D action game, with a mysterious but gentle storyline and some very tough combat. When you die -- and you'll do so a lot -- though, you just get transported to the beginning of the combat area with no punishment. In that way, it's got the ""live, die repeat"" mechanics of other indie games like Hotline Miami. Pre-orders for the Collector's Edition start today in PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One flavors, all priced at $65. If you order the PC version, you'll get a Steam code immediately, and the cool collector-y stuff late this summer. As the Xbox and PS4 versions aren't due out until summer, you'll get your code as soon as it's available. iam8bit, the store selling the special edition, says its goal is ""to have the boxes shipped out in concert with Hyper Light Drifter's console release."" In addition to the Collector's Edition, iam8bit is also selling a 4LP vinyl soundtrack and some fine art prints from the game."

If you think it's worth over six digits, Israeli start-up Sirin Labs just announced a smartphone for you. The Solarin costs PS9,500. After tax and conversion, that's roughly $16,500 or AU$22,700. The selling point of the phone is its KoolSpan military-grade encryption and Zimperium-based threat detection. ""Our core consumers are international business travellers that spend much of their lives on the move,"" company co-founder and CEO Tal Cohen said at the product's launch, according to CNN. He later warned that hacking ""is something that can happen to any one of us...it's just a question of if you're targeted or not."" The Solarin houses a 5.5-inch LED display with a 2K 2,048x1,080-pixel resolution screen. On the back is a 23.8-megapixel camera, and its sound system boasts three bass-boosted speakers. The phone is also said to be the first to use WiGig technology, which allows for speeds of up to 4.6Gbps. That all sounds impressive. But, then again, $16,500..."

Endemol Shine Studios acquired the TV rights to Mirror's Edge and is working with EA to transform it into a female-centric action series (much like the game itself). Deadline originally reported the deal and EA confirmed its existence to Engadget. ""We are excited to be working with Endemol Shine Studios to explore a potential Mirror's Edge project for television,"" an EA spokesperson said. The original Mirror's Edge hit the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008. It's a rapid-fire first-person game starring Faith, a freerunner, as she battles a dystopian government across a sleek, futuristic city. It was heralded for innovative gameplay mechanics yet criticized for not presenting a deep enough story to satisfy many couch-bound freerunners. Its long-awaited sequel, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, is due to land on Xbox One and PS4 on June 7th, and it promises to showcase a larger storyline and bigger city to explore. Endemol Shine Studios is the scripted division of Endemol Shine North America, meaning any Mirror's Edge TV show won't be a reality series (although, watching Faith freerun around the Big Brother house would be infinitely amusing). ""We clearly see Mirror's Edge as a franchise for the global TV audience,"" Endemol Shine Studios president Sharon Hall said, according to Deadline. ""It has a strong female protagonist, a wildly rabid fan base and a worldwide brand that Electronic Arts and EA DICE have done an amazing job establishing."""

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Notes read full article at http://www.effectiveecommerce.com/ecommerce-news-ep-2-spotlight-marketing-and-google-adwords-pla-updates/ E-commerce is the new trend that has taken the world by storm. Why spend loads of money to own an outlet and be limited to just a few consumers, when you can have your business on the internet and get millions of people to visit your online store every single day. About Us Effective E-commerce with Travis Marziani is an online broadcast for E-commerce operators and individuals looking to get into the business. In these short clip, a lot about E-commerce is addressed leaving you with loads of information that you would need to thrive in your business. The world of e-commerce can be quite daunting, if you step into it blindly without proper knowledge of what to do. These videos provide a number of helpful tips that would be of immense value to you and your business. Get where you want to be in as little time as possible! This episode of E-commerce News takes a look at how over 30,000 target consumers were drawn to an E-commerce site at no costs at all. Also, we take a look at how Ad-words and product listing ads can help to generate traffic from your target demographic. There are a number of ways to get exactly where you want to be in your business. These include: Spotlight marketing Spotlight marketing is a very important concept in E-commerce, and was used to get over 30,000 people to a website. Like most online business operators, when your business begins, you may be looking for a cheap way to get people to visit your website. Most of the techniques that E-commerce authors and advisers may preach would often require sizeable investments. One of the best ways to reach out to your target demographic is by first of all providing value to your customers. The hard truth is, if your product is not solving a dire need of consumers, very few people would even take a look at your business or want to partner with you. You may think that the best way to publicize your business is by publicizing the people you want to partner with and them to help you out in publicizing your business also. This may not work, as most people would relent at the thought of helping someone that is not known. The thought process then leads back to 'what exactly can you give that would be of value to your partners""? You need to get your ultimate true fans to give their honest opinion about how your product helps out. This is often known as your 'true-thousand' fans. Starting an E-commerce company that sells dance clothing required me providing a service of dance studios. This however required me getting the help of dance studios in the area and getting them to partner with me via their websites. The dance studios were reluctant to participate because most of them do not require your services because you are unknown. You need to rank for certain keywords that have the potential to place your business in the spotlight. A list was compiled and then customers that patronized dance clothing shared their opinions, which then reflected on the top dance studios around. This greatly warmed them up to want to do business with the brand. The dance studios then highlighted the brand and it got a lot of consumers to come on to the E-commerce website. Ad-words This is another great way to get a reasonable amount of traffic to your site. It is very important to make use of final URLs instead of destination URLs. Google has recently revamped their system for Ad-word searching and this helps to transfer customers directly to your brand."

Set fifteen years in the future, it's now commonplace for people to equip themselves with artificial limbs. But after the so-called ""aug incident,"" where augmented humans are covertly hacked and forced to turn violent, society is split down the middle -- both ethically and physically. Augmented and non-augmented individuals are forced to live separately, fuelling civil unrest. It's a gripping backdrop for a video game, and one you can now absorb through a new live-action trailer. Live-action video game trailers are normally a bit rubbish, but this one is surprisingly effective. You get a good sense of how the technology has developed, why so many people have embraced it, and a hint of the ""madness"" that gripped people during the pivotal ""aug incident."" Whether you're a longtime Deus Ex fan or a franchise beginner, it's enough to give you the gist of hero Adam Jensen's situation. An augmented individual himself, he works both for Interpol and a hacker group in order to find ""Illuminati,"" the people responsible for the lethal malfunctions. The game is set to land on August 23rd."

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f3a751ac842181db70a1"	"APPLE - Why is the Iphone 6 no longer a first-class smartphone?"

Lenovo unveiled the Phab2 Pro, the first flagship Project Tango smartphone, on Thursday at the company's Tech World event in San Francisco. The unveiling comes more than two years after Google first introduced Project Tango, its (at the time) experimental effort to bring computer vision and 3D-sensing abilities to smartphones and tablets. SEE ALSO: Google Daydream and Project Tango: We've gotta get these guys together In addition to the typical cameras and sensors that power most smartphones, Tango devices are equipped with motion and depth sensors, along with computer vision software, to create augmented-reality experiences that wouldn't be otherwise be possible on a smartphone. The Phab2 Pro is massive, weighing more than half a pound. These extra components (and the types of experiences they create) help account for the Phab2 Pro's massive size -- and it is massive. Its Quad HD display clocks in at a plus-size 6.4 inches, and it weighs more than half a pound. ""It was a tough engineering feat,"" Lenovo's VP of Android Jeff Meredith tells Mashable.""You need a relatively large screen to be able to fully take advantage and enjoy the experience of what Tango offers... we felt that 6.4 was the right selection for us at this stage."" Display aside, the handset is also equipped with a 4K-ready 16MP camera, 4GB of RAM and dual SIM slots all powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. It comes in two color variants: champagne gold and gunmetal gray and comes with 64GB of storage, along with a microSD slot. Lenovo's Phab2 Pro. Image: Lenovo Those would be more than respectable specs by most Android flagship standards but more impressive may be the price: The Phab2 Pro will cost just $499 when it goes on sale in August. For those who want to spend a little less, Lenovo is also introducing two other Tango-enabled handsets, the $199 Phab2 and $299 Phab2 Plus.  The $199 Phab2 also has a 6.4-inch HD display and is equipped with a 13MP camera. The $299 Phab2 Plus, on the other hand, is being positioned as a midrange device that doesn't skimp on the camera. The device, also 6.4-inches, has two 13MP rear-facing cameras with f/2.0 lenses. The cameras are powered by the same image processor inside of a Leica camera, Lenovo says. Of course, extra cameras, 3D-sensing, and advanced computer vision are only as good as the apps that can actually take advantage of them. There are already more than 100 Tango-ready apps in Google Play, including several augmented reality games. Gaming, says Meredith, will likely be one of the biggest use cases for Project Tango since it marks the first time gamers can get a true augmented-reality experience on a smartphone. But AR is good for more than just games: Lenovo also showed off an app from Google called Measure, which allows people to measure the dimensions of the spaces around them just by pointing the device at the area. Lowe's, one of the first retailers that will sell the Phab2 Pro, also has an app that allows users to see visualizations of how new appliances and other items will look in their houses before they buy them. The Phab2Pro will go on sale in August for $399, the $299 Phab2 Plus and $199 Phab2 will both be available in September.  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

It's blaring from the speakers mounted nearby--""Shadow,"" a ballad he wrote and produced with his friend Sam Tsui a few years ago--but he hasn't played the song in a while, and can't remember the piano part. (When you've arranged, recorded, produced, written, directed, edited, and mixed more than 300 songs and videos, you tend to forget a few things.) Schneider hunches over his Yamaha keyboard, boxers sticking out the back of his jeans; after a minute of banging around, the muscle memory kicks in, and the part comes back. Then, just as suddenly, it's time to go. He slips on his shoes, runs his hands through his messy hair, and jumps in his car to head to tonight's shoot. Over the next several hours, Schneider will direct, produce, and perform in a music video for a cover of the song ""Roses"" by the Chainsmokers. Schneider arranged, mixed, and recorded the audio on this one--but he's not the star of this video. That would be Tsui, his closest collaborator, who recorded the vocals yesterday in Schneider's home studio. Schneider's rarely the star of his videos, but he's without question the star of his channel. And like many of the platform's stars, YouTube has made him famous. Like, 7 million subscribers and more than a billion views famous. One of Schneider's biggest fans is actually in town: Kayla, the 16-year-old whose only wish for Christmas vacation was to fly to LA to meet Schneider and Tsui. They both know who she is, because she's one of the super-duperfans who comments on and shares absolutely everything they do. Her mom reached out to Schneider months earlier, and Schneider and Tsui decided to surprise her. So they told Kayla no, sorry, too busy, but offered to have a friend give her a tour of ""a studio they shoot in sometimes"" that's owned by Alex Goot, another well-known YouTuber. As she enters an abandoned-looking building in an industrial neighborhood of downtown LA, Kayla has no idea what's waiting for her upstairs. Schneider at his home recording studio. Julian Berman for WIRED Tsui is behind the piano; Schneider sits on a wooden stool with a guitar on his lap. (He re-learned the piano part for nothing, apparently.) They've set up another stool just inside the door for Kayla to sit on. When Kayla opens the door, the guys start to play. As Tsui sings the first lines of ""Shadow""--Kayla's favorite song--Kayla practically melts onto the stool. Her whole body is shaking. When I ask her a few minutes later how she felt, she can barely answer. ""This is the best day of my life you're witnessing right now,"" she says, without ever taking her eyes off Schneider. After a few minutes of serenading, selfies, and chatter, Schneider shoos the rest of us into a corner of the large square room. He drags the piano across the floor toward a better-lit corner, and stands Tsui in front of a microphone in the exact center of the room. It's time to shoot tonight's video, for the millions of other fans who don't get to watch live. A couple of weeks from now, Schneider will publish it on his YouTube channel, where his 7 million followers will devour their new take on ""Roses."" The comments will say the same things they always do, the same things you'd see on a Bieber video or shouted at the One Directioners. ""Wow, this version is much better then the original."" ""This gives me the chills omg, so amazing."" ""this is a million times better than that radio trash."" In case you hadn't noticed, YouTube has taken over the music industry. A much-cited Nielsen study in 2012 found that more teens listen to music on YouTube than any other platform. A similar study in 2015 showed that YouTube accounts for fully half of all music streaming. Radio's not dead, and neither is iTunes. But they're not the future; YouTube is. And Kurt Hugo Schneider--he goes by all three names professionally, or KHS for short--may just be the most powerful YouTuber musician on the planet. He's among the most prominent of this new kind of artist: native to the Internet, skilled in everything from video production to sultry falsetto to distribution strategy. Together, these artists are charting a new path to fame and fortune that begins, and increasingly ends, on YouTube. There are plenty of YouTube success stories. But Schneider is different. He can sing and dance, sure, but he takes most pleasure in being the guy behind the piano (and camera, and mixing board, and editing suite). He's a producer in an era where everyone wants to be the frontman. He's become the hub of a teeming group of YouTuber musicians; in fact, he's responsible for elevating and breaking many of their careers. Schneider is Rick Rubin for a new generation. You bring him a good voice, he'll make something everyone wants to see. The entertainer Music may be Schneider's life and work now, but when the 27-year-old really wants to show off, he'll play two games of chess at a time. Blindfolded. ""All the great players can do it,"" he says, shrugging. While he was growing up outside of Philadelphia, Schneider's parents had a rule: you can do and be anything you want, but you have to practice something. After four weeks of piano lessons, young Kurt decided music wasn't it. He eventually landed on chess, which consumed his life for a decade. He became a chess master at 15, and was one of the best junior players in the country. As he got to the end of high school, though, he'd reached the point where the only way to get better was to commit fully. ""It doesn't matter if it's chess or ballet or sports,"" he says, over bowls of pho at a small restaurant down the street from his new house. ""If you want to be the best at something, you have to do it to the exclusion of everything else."" Unwilling to make the sacrifice, Schneider mostly stopped playing chess, and began college at Yale in 2006 the way most kids begin college: completely unsure about the future. Yale has a renowned music program, but Schneider declared a math major because he knew he'd ace his classes without trying very hard. It came easy; he still remembers the one B+ he got, and that was only because he accidentally skipped the midterm. (He wound up graduating magna cum laude, which says a little about grade inflation and a lot about the fact that Schneider seems to be exceptional at basically everything he tries.) While he was supposed to be in class, he was mostly hanging out in the school's Digital Media Center for the Arts. He'd gotten a job there, mostly for the perks: unfettered off-hours access to two studios, plus a whole bunch of audio and video recording equipment. The studio quickly became a second home--Schneider and his friends kept a sleeping bag in one of the recording rooms, just in case. Julian Berman for WIRED With help from a much-loved lab director named Lee Faulkner, Schneider began learning his way around the lab's many systems: software like Logic and Cubase, the ins and outs of recording and mixing. Once he had a grasp of things, he started inviting music students to work with him. He needed guinea pigs, and they needed his help.They were all good musicians, but had no idea how to make themselves sound good. ""All their recordings sounded terrible,"" Schneider remembers. ""Underwater, muffled, just bad."" So he made them all the same offer: come to the studio, do your thing, and he'd handle the rest. At the same time, he was beginning to experiment with all the camera equipment in the studio. In a world full of great music, he'd realized at some point, music isn't enough. ""Most musicians on YouTube focus entirely on the audio,"" he says. ""But if people just wanted to hear something great they would go on Spotify or Pandora, or open their iTunes library or something. You go on YouTube because you want to see something really cool."" The first video Schneider ever put on YouTube--the reason he created his channel in the first place--was a commercial he made for Yale's closed-circuit TV network, YTV. Schneider wrote a shockingly catchy song about two kids who don't want to go out and party, they just want to hang out in their dorm and watch YTV. It played all over campus, and its two stars became minor campus celebrities. Weeks later, a blog called IvyGate, which is like Gawker for Ivy Leaguers and is a real thing that exists, saw the spot. The post wasn't nice--""YTV Attempts to Out-Gay Harvard Crooner,"" the headline snarked--but it sent 15,000 viewers to his campy commercial. Schneider couldn't believe there were so many people watching dumb videos online. And he wanted to make more of them. In 2007, though, ""YouTuber"" wasn't a job title. And YouTube was only beginning to figure out its place in the music world. No Label Necessary It's still doing that, actually. The music industry wants more money out of YouTube, but it desperately needs YouTube's unmatched size and reach. Even as the platform has grown to a billion-plus users and an effectively infinite video catalog, music remains its most popular genre by far. And over time, the platform has shifted from a discovery engine to a full-fledged music platform. YouTube Red lets you listen without ads; YouTube Music is a rich and dedicated streaming service. And the platform is still uniquely artist-friendly. ""You see some of the successful YouTube artists,"" says industry analyst Mark Mulligan, ""they started off doing covers, because covers is an immediate way to build a relationship with an audience."" They'd show up in related videos and search results, and fans would encounter artists that felt like more than a faceless brand. That kind of interaction was critical. ""They're liking and sharing, remixing, covering music that they love,"" says Vivien Lewit, YouTube's head of artist relations. ""And that expression and new creation of sorts, just helps drive new community around video."" Now, most high-profile YouTubers like Schneider could get record deals in an instant. Labels are clamoring to sign them. And that used to be the goal. ""Part of my function many years ago,"" Lewit says, ""was that I would be someone who would try to present opportunities to the artists by introducing them to record labels."" She still works to land artists like Schneider deals for TV, movies, and books, but YouTube is the center of the universe. ""Signing a deal to a record label or TV network isn't going to give you as big an audience as you have on YouTube,"" Mulligan says. ""And it will constrain what you can do."" This new breed of do-everything artists want control. And it's not like they need radio play to get discovered. Julian Berman for WIRED For Schneider, keeping control means freedom to try weird stuff. And weird stuff is, at least in part, what's made him so successful. You can see it all the way back to October of 2008, in the first video that Schneider likes enough to still have public on his channel. It's a cover of ""Can I Have This Dance,"" from High School Musical 3. Schneider and some friends saw the movie on opening weekend, and knew the song would be a hit. So he asked Tsui and another friend, Rachel, if they wanted to record a duet. Both said sure, but the night before, Rachel cancelled. Schneider had been playing around with an idea, though. Maybe he could clone Tsui, so the singer would be able to duet with himself. And maybe that would be cooler. Maybe people would share it. He recorded four different vocal parts with Tsui, then stayed up all night editing and mixing and learning how to do the whole cloning thing. The video opens on two empty stools in front of a white screen. You can see the rolls of paper on the floor, and the frame for the screen around the edges. (Schneider's production value has gone up a bit since this video.) Tsui walks out in a red sweatshirt, holding a microphone. He sits down, smiles, and starts singing. A few seconds later, another Tsui comes out. Same red sweatshirt, same microphone. He sits in the stool next to himself, and starts singing the harmony. Two other Tsuis come and go throughout the song. Even watching it now, it's a cool effect. In its first day, the video got 1,000 views. ""It was probably because the movie was popular,"" Schneider says, ""so people were searching for the song."" It was Schneider's biggest debut yet, and validation of his theory about shareability. Ever since that day, he gives the same advice to people who ask about how to be successful on YouTube. ""You have to answer the question, 'why does someone want to share this video?' And if you don't have an answer to that question, it's probably not going to do well."" Good singers singing songs? Fine. Good singers singing popular, new songs? Better. A guy singing a duet with himself? Now that's shareable. Go down the list of YouTube's most popular music videos, and there's always that one thing that made people share it. That's the secret sauce. If you want to talk shareable, though, what happened in June of 2009 might be hard for Schneider--or anyone--to top. Michael Jackson had just died, and a friend asked him to arrange a medley for his Duke a cappella group, which they'd sing as a tribute. Schneider did the arrangement, and decided it was too good to just use for one concert and never hear again. So he and Tsui made a video. This time it's six Tsuis on stage, singing the medley in six-part harmony, with Schneider off to the left on percussion. Schneider uploaded the video on July 24, 2009. About a month later, it had about 100,000 views, which was ""by far the best any video had ever done for us,"" Schneider says. But then on August 29, Perez Hilton, the snark-tastic blogger still at the peak of his powers, tweeted the video. Cue explosion. By the next day, the video was on Fox News and the Yahoo homepage. Ellen DeGeneres called. So did Oprah. By the end of that summer, Schneider and Tsui had gone fully, certifiably, life-changingly viral. And things never really slowed down again. Gaming the Change Fast forward to 2016, and Schneider's is now the 34th most popular music channel on YouTube, and number 121 overall. (Number 122? The NBA.) On the music list, virtually everyone above Schneider is either Miley Cyrus or someone equally mainstream. Still below him on the charts? Calvin Harris, Lady Gaga, and, uh, everyone else on the planet. He adds about 3,300 new subscribers every day. He's done branded videos with companies like Samsung, Buick, and Coca-Cola, including a Coke ad that ran during the Super Bowl. He's as big a star as anyone on YouTube not named PewDiePie. But the more Schneider has come to understand how YouTube and the Internet work, the more he understands how unstable it all can be. And in the YouTube music scene, there's no more cautionary tale than Dave Days. In 2011, Days and his pop-punk song covers and parodies had more subscribers than any other musician on YouTube. But he never changed his approach, or his material, and now his subscriber and view counts dwindle toward zero. It's easy to win fans on the Internet, and even easier to lose them. Julian Berman for WIRED Schneider's way of staying relevant is to constantly change. As soon as Schneider masters something, he moves onto something else, not unlike the way Louis CK throws out his material every year and starts over. He has to: the YouTube zeitgeist moves so quickly, and so many people are copying and learning from the videos they see, that it's hard to ever remember who did things first. After Schneider's cover of Nelly's ""Just a Dream"" came out, for instance, people loved the editing style he'd used. He calls it a box edit, layering three or four instruments and singers simultaneously into the frame. It immediately became his most popular video, racking up more than 100 million views to date, and Schneider attributes the success at least in part to the editing style. But as soon as it went viral, he says, ""everybody fucking ripped it off."" Schneider doesn't curse much, and always apologizes when he does. But this stuff makes him mad. And it makes him try harder. Over time, he's ramped up the difficulty of his work to the point where it's hard to even copy--like the one-take videos he's become known for, artfully choreographed so that as the camera moves through a house, or down the street, the talent flows all around the frame. Every shoot starts in Schneider's notebook: ""I draw the room,"" he says, ""and then each person is a letter."" He draws everyone's path, and they shoot over and over until they get it right. Schneider's done one-takes on Segways and hoverboards, and he has this idea about having the singers catch and release a drone during a one-take. He's done a couple of 360-degree videos, too. And he loves playing weird instruments, or playing three instruments in one video, or using traffic sounds as percussion. He does popular songs, old songs, more and more original songs. Even when he does branded videos, he finds cool ways to integrate the product--forget just driving in a Buick, he's going to make every sound in the video with a Buick. He's on a relentless search for the next shareable thing. And he has a unique freedom to experiment because it's what his audience expects. That goes all the way back to the fact that it's not just Schneider on camera. ""Most channels on YouTube,"" Schneider says, ""especially music channels, it's just the artist. And every video is this person singing. Or whatever. Whereas my channel, I can have anyone singing. I can kind of do anything."" This approach has turned Schneider into a resource not just for other YouTubers looking for an edge, but for anyone looking for new ideas about music videos. When Avicii wanted to make the first-ever 360-degree music video for his song ""Waiting for Love,"" he called Schneider. So did Rixton, for ""Me And My Broken Heart."" ""I think if it was just a normal music video, I wouldn't be at the top of the list to direct it,"" Schneider says. But because it's YouTube, and because it's new tech, he's the guy. (A few days before we meet, fellow YouTube sensation Todrick Hall called Schneider for 360-degree shooting tips.) Schneider's worked with other A-listers like Jason Derulo and Hunter Hayes, YouTube stars like Bethany Mota, and many more. He recently struck a deal with Sony to do videos with some of the label's top talent, too. ""I was attracted to him for his director's eye, and his creative videos,"" says Lee Stimmel, Sony's head of original content. ""They're really, really different. And it's hard to stand out in that space."" In every case, it's the same offer as always: come to the studio, do your thing, and he'll do the rest. Julian Berman for WIRED A few days after the Kayla-inspired shoot with Tsui, Schneider is back in the same downtown LA studio, shooting with Austin Percario, a 20-year-old singer. Today's song is the James Bay ballad ""Let it Go."" Schneider's given himself the task playing piano and tambourine simultaneously, and he's sitting on the bench trying to work out the rhythm. Normally, Schneider has singers just sing--""It makes my life easier,"" he says, ""in that I only have to worry about me doing all the random things""--but today, he's assigned Percario the job of violently hitting the bass drum during the song's emotional ending. Percario's nervous about it. He listens to the track over and over, playing air drums to get the beat just right, nodding in time with the click in the audio. After a few full rehearsals, he and Schneider are both satisfied they've got it down. While Percario checks his hair, Schneider throws on his vest and checks the lighting for approximately the 93rd time. Then he jogs over to the stereo to restart the track on his iPhone, and they start shooting. Like many of Schneider's collaborators, Percario came to him. After auditioning for American Idol and the X Factor, Percario was desperate to do more music. ""I emailed his dad like four times before I got a response,"" Percario tells me. He's worked with Schneider a couple of times now, and he's finally getting over the awkwardness of singing into a camera over a track of your own voice. The drum part is the most Schneider's ever asked him to do, and once Percario gets the hang of it he gets way into it. All things considered, this shoot isn't terribly complex. It's not a one-take, it doesn't involve segways or complicated dance routines. It's just Schneider and Percario. The whole thing only takes about two hours, and maybe a half-dozen plays of ""Let it Go."" When they finish, Manny Figs, Schneider's cameraman and only full-time employee, heads home to do a first pass on the edit. Once he's done, Schneider will spend the next few weeks tweaking and perfecting. For now, Schneider gets back into his car, which has a harp in the back he's teaching himself how to play, and heads home. He has more videos to work on, more songs to learn and write, more potential collaborators to vet. In the room next to his home studio, he's set up a new instrument, a series of carefully carved bamboo tubes called an angklung. A fan gave it to him, and he wants to use it in a video. He has no idea how to play it, of course, but that's no problem. He'll figure it out. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Architecture-led hazard analysis using architecture description languages (ADLs) such as AADL has become an effective capability in safety fault management. The cost of successfully addressing safety compliance has been greatly reduced through the use of extensions to AADL that automate safety analysis and produce safety assessment reports to meet recommended practice standards (such as SAE ARP4761) [Cervin 2006]. We can leverage these successful capabilities to the security domain especially the automated analysis of security faults [Firesmith 2003]."

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"57478005d48d087442763a3b"	"ForcePhone software makes any mobile device pressure sensitive Engadget Engadget save share save share save share save share save share save share"	"Engadget"	"A team from the University of Michigan have developed a novel means of giving any mobile device the same sort of force-sensitive capabilities found on Apple's flagship iPhone 6s. Dubbed ForcePhone, the software leverages two features that literally every smartphone has -- a microphone and a speaker -- do to what very few OEM device manufacturers have managed. It causes the phone to continually emit an 18kHz buzz, which is too high for the human ear to detect. However, it's not too high for the phone's microphone to detect. When the user presses a finger against the screen, the pitch changes slightly. Pressing harder causes the pitch to shift further, which the mic picks up and translates into commands for the software. With it, users would conceivably be able to dial their phones or navigate through menus simply by squeezing their screens in different patterns. ""Having expensive and bulky sensors installed into smartphones can solve every problem we have solved, but the added cost and laborious installation prevent phone manufacturers from doing it,"" University of Michigan doctoral student Yu-Chih Tung said in a statement. ""Our sound-based solution can fill this gap, providing the functionality without making any hardware modification. Everything is just software."" The system isn't quite ready for public consumption just yet, however. Its inventors will demo the ForcePhone June 27-29 in Singapore at MobiSys 2016."

Intrepid fan TomButcher has noticed that at least one tune in the soundtrack, ""Cyberdemon,"" shows both pentagrams and the number 666 when you visualize the music's frequencies through a spectrogram. Composer Mick Gordon recently teased that this hidden sinister imagery might be present in a video (below at the 3:29 mark), but there's no doubt about it now. Clearly, he remembers the days when the original Doom's hellish artwork had some parents in a frenzy. Music aficionados will be quick to note that stealthy image insertion isn't new. Aphex Twin (aka Richard James) legendarily inserted his own face into the spectrogram for a track on his Windowlicker EP, for a start. All the same, it's good to know that the art of sneaking in subtle audio references is far from dead -- even if you're unlikely to see this feat in many other games going forward."

Amazon Payments Partner Programme allows ecommerce companies to use Amazon Payments on their sites, and aims to be mutually beneficial for Amazon and the retailers using the programme. The programme is invite-only and currently only covers the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Ecommerce providers and developers invited to the programme will receive training, technical resources, planning support and account management. The more well-known brands may even be eligible for so-called ""co-marketing activities"". The launch means that Amazon is directly competing with the likes of other online payment providers such as PayPal. The social payments company Circle has expanded to the UK. Circle allows users to send money to one another. It works across borders and does not charge users any fees. At present, it covers three currencies (US dollars, UK pounds and Bitcoin) and it plans to expand to cover Euros later this year. It has said that it will launch in the European Union gradually, rather than in all countries at once, although it has not yet revealed which countries will be targeted first. There are similar social payments platforms in China, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, but there are currently no such apps in the West that have gained significant popularity, something that Circle describes as a huge opportunity. The telecoms company Orange has announced that it will invest 75 million Euros in Africa Internet Group. Africa Internet Group owns some of the most successful digital companies in the African continent, including the ecommerce site Jumia, the hotel booking platform Jovago, the jobs site Everjobs and the transport app EasyTaxi. A spokesperson from Orange commented on the investment, saying: ""With this strategic investment, Orange now has the capacity to play a leading role in the fast-growing e-commerce market in Africa. This investment will enable us to significantly develop our ability to market products and services developed by Orange Middle East and Africa over the Internet."" Smartphone and tablet use is surging in Germany, according to research by BurdaForward. The study found that almost 80% of Germans have a smartphone and 46% have a tablet. These devices are being used extensively to access the internet, with 84% of smartphone owners saying that they used their device every day to surf the web. The number of people who said they used their tablet to access the web every day was also high, at 62%. Users tended to use their devices for prolonged periods of time, with 35% of smartphone internet users spending over an hour online on their device every day, with this figure jumping up to 42% amongst tablet internet users. Ecommerce is a popular activity for German smartphone and tablet users, with almost 40% of smartphone users and 57% of tablet users having bought something online using their device. Germany has an internet penetration rate of 87%, equivalent to 72 million people. And finally, one slightly unusual industry has gone online in China: the funeral industry. China has an aging population and the country's death rate has been rising steadily for the last 15 years, making death an opportunity that some innovative and sensitive companies have decided to seize. Yiko is one such company. It is an ecommerce site that allows users to search for grave plots, compare prices and buy online. It also sells other funeral-related materials such as urns and memorial rings. Its company representatives go into care homes to engage in fun activities, such as singing with residents, and talk openly to them about the funeral options available to them. Its to-the-point and positive approach regarding death seems to be working well, with the company never having needed to seek funding from investors."
