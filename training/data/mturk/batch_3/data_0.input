"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f92e51ac8421ccf54bc1"	"Internet of Things (IOT)"	"youtube.com"	"Internet of Things (IOT)"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JQsOx-Pv4bo/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/JQsOx-Pv4bo"	"5758f91e51ac8421ccf54b83"	"""Internet of Things"" New Year's Eve 12/31/15 (video)"	"youtube.com"	"""Internet of Things"" New Year's Eve 12/31/15 (video)"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TnjIXlnaN00/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/TnjIXlnaN00"

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

It is like cautious tail. Crazy Ryvan (that is me) has to fight off an italian guy named Arduino and the haters that only like raspberry pie with his #menacingPomPom and Christmas hat with a 5-year plan. We discuss the nest thermostat and how it is just a ploy for the aliens to take over your house and tell your fridge that you are fat. I love pie, but only sugar-free pie that is so punkin it could have its own band, because I am diabetic. So much more, so I won't tell you all the things, you have to watch. This is not blog post that makes you bored. This is energetic and dynamic vlog episode with background music and stuff. Very professional vlogger I think. Tell me in comments if you agree.

The project looks at how digital technologies like machine learning, cloud computing, and the internet of things are changing existing industries and creating entirely new ones. There are now hundreds of startups attacking traditional markets as a result of the democratization of technology, increased access to funds and a rising entrepreneurial culture. Start-ups are achieving scale far quicker than analogue companies ever did. Average Fortune 500 companies took 20 years to reach a market cap of $1 billion, Google managed it in eight years, and the likes of Uber, Snapchat and Xiaomi in three years or less. 88% of Fortune 500 companies from 1955 - 2015 no longer exist. Digital disruption has been a major driver of this, consequently Fortune 500 companies must use their considerable resources to fight off the attacks of leaner challengers and remain relevant in a digital age. Speakers: - Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology Officer, Accenture, USA. - Erik Brynjolfsson, Director, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, MIT Sloan School of Management. - Bruce Weinelt, Head of Digital Transformation, World Economic Forum.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Unfortunately, you've probably spent untold minutes? hours? days? of your life swiping up on apps in a fruitless effort to do so. The man in charge of iOS at Apple, Craig Federighi, has confirmed that there is no need to bother killing your apps because it won't help your battery life. Mashable reports that Federighi's confirmation came in an email to an Apple customer, who had originally written to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In an email that was later published on 9to5Mac, the customer wrote to Cook and asked, ""do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary for battery life?""

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Researchers from MIT, the Swiss Institute of Technology and the Italian National Research Council came up with the idea for the slot-based interaction called Light Traffic. Their system would use sensors to keep driverless cars at a safe distance from each other and allocate slots as they arrive at a crossroads. Speeds would be automatically adjusted on approach to ensure the vehicles take it in turns to pass across without having to stop. ""Traffic intersections are particularly complex spaces, because you have two flows of traffic competing for the same piece of real estate,"" said Carlo Ratti, director of the MIT Senseable City Lab. ""But a slot-based system moves the focus from the traffic flow level to the vehicle level,"" he continued. ""Ultimately, it's a much more efficient system, because vehicles will get to an intersection exactly when there is a slot available to them."" The team believes that this system could dramatically reduce the amount of pollution emitted by the waiting vehicles unnecessarily burning fuel. It also claims that twice as many cars would be able to pass through crossings in the same amount of time as at intersections controlled by traffic lights. This would help alleviate congestion, extend the lifespan of current infrastructure and reduce the need for new roads. ""It is important that we start looking into the impact of self-driving vehicles at the city level as soon as possible,"" Ratti said. ""The lifetime of today's road infrastructure is many decades and it will certainly be impacted by the mobility disruptions brought in by new technologies."" Companies ranging from Bentley to Google are working on plans for driverless cars. Goodyear recently unveiled a design for a spherical tyre made for smart vehicles. At this year's Geneva Motor Show, Nissan and Foster + Partners unveiled a vision for a connected network that would enable autonomous vehicles to power homes.

No one was hurt and the damage was minimal, but the crash shows that companies developing the technology still have a ways to go before autonomous vehicles are actually commonplace. In mid-February, as it was driving on a three-lane road in Mountain View, California, a Google self-driving car trying to merge into the center lane hit a public bus. The car had expected the bus to yield. In a statement issued on Monday, Google says it ""bears some responsibility"" in last month's crash, reported Reuters. In the same statement, Google says it has reviewed the crash and made some changes in their cars' software to prevent similar incidents. Unlike human drivers who can react quickly to unexpected behavior or obstacles on the road, autonomous vehicles aren't always able to do that yet. This is just one of the few important wrinkles Google and other tech companies testing autonomous vehicles need to smooth out. Another flaw with Google's cars is that they require the roads they're traveling on to be precisely mapped out, otherwise the vehicle is unsure of how to behave. These maps are extremely detailed digitizations of the physical world, where things like even the height of every single curb is measured out. However, in general the technology is well-developed and companies have been running tests on the cars for years. Before February's incident, Google reported that its driverless cars had only been involved in 17 accidents, all of which were caused by human error. What allows self-driving cars to be such ""careful"" drivers is the combination of GPS systems, cameras and various sensors that tell the cars where they're going, how to get there and what's around them at all times. The autonomous vehicles use GPS to match their position with customized Google maps. This allows the cars to select a starting point and an end point, as well as to choose the best routes to take. Radars in the front and back of the cars keep track of other vehicles on the road. The LIDAR sensor rotates 360 degrees and detects the distance between the autonomous vehicles and surrounding objects. A video camera behind the front windshield is able to read road signs and traffic lights. ------------------------------------------------------------- Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

"youtube.com"	"Apple and Google, among many other companies, are working on autonomous technology to create driverless cars, thus creating safer roads and potentially the end of parking tickets. The smart tech might be great for drivers but financially bad for local cities. Without speeding, parking or other traffic violation tickets, city budgets could be potentially losing out on millions of dollars. Some cities, such as DC, make roughly $37.5 million on driver related fines alone. Some state regulators are trying to enhance restrictions and ban autonomous cars altogether, citing safety as the main concern. However, in the six years Google has been testing autonomous vehicles, there have only been 11 accidents.

A driverless car had to be brought to a halt by police using spike strips after it spun uncontrollably for several minutes on a busy residential street in Moreno Valley, California on Tuesday. Moreno Valley resident Tommy Anderson caught the bizarre incident on tape. Tommy Anderson said he was worried about the responding officers as he watched them get close to the spinning car Anderson told CBS Los Angeles he came onto Frederick Street and saw a man lying on top of a Honda Accord spinning in reverse, trying desperately to stop it. By the time Anderson got his phone out to record a video of the scene, the man had gotten off the car, which was still busy doing doughnuts on the asphalt with an empty driver's seat. 'To turn the corner and see a guy just hanging on belly first on the roof and spinning around, I didn't know what to think. It was unreal,' Anderson told CBS. CBS reported that Moreno Valley police had to use tire shredders to bring the unruly vehicle to a stop. The station reported that the entire street had to be closed off during the ordeal. According to CBS, the car's owner told police he believed the wild ride was the result of a mechanical error. As he watched police operate, Anderson's thoughts went out to the responding officers, he told CBS. 'I was actually pretty worried about the officers. They were getting pretty close to the car and, who knows, it's a driverless car, you never know which direction that thing may go,' Anderson said."

If you still believe this is real, please remove your tinfoil hat. First the clutch pedal was eliminated. Staging, shutting down, releasing the chutes and even shifting has been automated now. On some of today's Pro Mod's there is little left for a driver to control other than the throttle, brake and steering wheel. Following the current path of Pro Mod automation, we forecast that the next step would be eliminating the driver completely. Removing human error can lead to tremendous advancements on the racetrack, so we have engineered a solution to solve this problem. It is our pleasure to introduce the world's first fully automated, driverless race car. Check out video for a demonstration of the new system.

But have you ever wondered who would actually make the cars? Well, if the rumor mill turns out to be right on this one, it's going to be Ford. Yahoo Autos cites three sources suggesting that Google and Ford have been in talks, and the official announcement will be made at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show to be held in Las Vegas this January. Google makes the self-driving system, but it doesn't own a car factory ... at least not yet. It needs an established motor company to turn its dreams into a reality right now, and clearly feels Ford is the best fit. Both Google and Ford are declining to comment, but we're only two weeks away from the official announcement. We may even see a functioning Google/Ford prototype tooting around the Las Vegas strip, and if we do, you can be sure Digital Trends will bring it to you. Folks, in case you missed it, history was made last night. After a 24-hour launch delay, Space X successfully launched a rocket, deployed 11 satellites into low-earth orbit, then returned to earth for a perfect landing. Space X's previous attempts at sticking a landing this year have resulted in unfortunate failures, and the private aeronautics company even lost a rocket last June when it exploded on its way to the International Space Station. But after company founder Elon Musk sent scientists back to the drawing board, they returned to some seriously well-deserved fanfare, as everything about the launch and landing was textbook-perfection. Just the way we like it. Finally, I'm going to get up on my editorial soap box for a second here and ask a question not enough journalists are asking right now: What the hell hackers? Have you no code? No honor? If all you normal, ethical folks are wondering why I'm outraged, it's because news has emerged that the unscrupulous a-holes that exposed Hello Kitty fan site SanrioTown.com's security flaws have in effect created a data breach that exposes 3.3 million users' personal info, including that of an undisclosed amount of children aged between 13 and 15. Kids, you guys. Kids. On what planet is this ok? Worse, this comes on the heels of kids tech toy-maker VTech's huge hack, which exposed a bunch of parent and child account data. Where's Anonoymous in all of this? How about some hacker self-policing, huh, guys? It's anarchy out there, I guess, but it goes to prove that parents need to be as diligent about managing their kids' security online as well as offline.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f97151ac8421ccf54d18"	"Who Is Responsible for a Driverless Car Accident?"

What will their impact be on the way America delivers a myriad of services, from emergency medical assistance to package delivery? How advanced is the technology today? And why is Google one of the world's leaders in researching, designing and building autonomous vehicles? Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car program answered those questions during a keynote address at the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, in Washington D.C. January 13, 2016. Urmson said Google's primary motivation for creating driverless cars is to improve safety, mobility and reliability by reducing traffic crashes and the amount of time people waste sitting in traffic. Urmson also described the progress his team is making in rapidly advancing the technology.

A Google driverless car has been involved in a collision with a bus in California. The tech company has admitted at least partial responsibility for the accident which occurred on 14 February. It is thought to have happened while the company was testing 24 of the cars fitted with sensors and cameras near the tech firm's Silicon Valley headquarters. In a report filed with California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) the company reveals the car was trying to navigate its way round some sandbags at 2mph when it hit the bus that was travelling at 15mph. Google's driverless cars have been involved in more than a dozen collisions but in most cases the vehicles were rear-ended. If it is determined Google's car was at fault over this crash it will be the first time one of its driverless vehicles has caused an accident while in autonomous mode. Google says the accident came from the same kind of negotiations and misunderstandings that take place between human drivers every day. The company says its cars will now have a better understanding that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to give way than smaller ones. A DMV spokeswoman said the agency hoped to speak with Google soon about what went wrong. Earlier this month, transport bosses in the UK revealed they were in ""active discussions"" with Google about trialling their driverless cars in the UK. Deputy mayor for transport Isabel Dedring said her office had spoken to Google ""at least half a dozen times"" over the past three years."

Unfortunately, you've probably spent untold minutes? hours? days? of your life swiping up on apps in a fruitless effort to do so. The man in charge of iOS at Apple, Craig Federighi, has confirmed that there is no need to bother killing your apps because it won't help your battery life.

However, even with the Popular Mechanics rendition of the futuristic car, the reality was that cars looked more like a locomotive than an egg.

Unlike the Heathrow pods, they will not need dedicated tracks. The Greenwich trial is one of four in the UK to test driverless technology and public reaction to it. Apart from the Gateway (Greenwich Automated Transport Environment), the other trials will take place in Bristol, Coventry and Milton Keynes. The PS8m project is jointly funded by government agency Innovate UK and industry. Seven of the pods will be tested on the pavements around the Greenwich Peninsula, where the 02 Arena is based, from July. Routes are still being worked out but are likely to include residential areas, the North Greenwich tube station and businesses around the O2. The design is different from the one shown off at the launch of the scheme, when a shuttle vehicle designed by autonomous vehicle firm Phoenix Wings was demonstrated. ""That was perfect for the demonstration and we did consider using it but we had a procurement process and chose the design we have now,"" Prof Nick Reed, technical director for the Gateway project, told the BBC. ""This vehicle has millions of miles under its belt and now we have to take it outside of the track and modify it for use on pavements,"" he added. The so-called UltraPODs currently in service at Heathrow carry passengers between the car park and Terminal 5. In the five years they have been in use, they have carried 1.5 million passengers and travelled three million kilometres (1.8 million miles). Westfield Sportscars, a British carmaker, will be responsible for manufacturing and testing of the pods. Heathrow Enterprise will design the software while a third British firm, Oxbotica, will provide mapping and other sensors to ensure the vehicles are safe. The pods will have three months of testing, first with invited users and then with the general public. Each pod can carry six passengers but will require a steward to be present at all times to press the emergency button in the case of a problem. The trial of the pods will reveal a wealth of data, said Prof Reed. ""It will tell us whether people trust and accept these vehicles and how they would work as part of the urban landscape,"" he said. The government wants to become a world leader in the area of driverless car technology."

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f97451ac8421ccf54d43"	"Is technology limiting our humanity?"	"youtube.com"	"From Big Data to the driverless car, we seem to live in an age of dizzying technological progress, which many hail as a 'new industrial revolution'. Robotic intelligence is becoming so advanced that many warn machines could take white-collar jobs within a generation, while computers are moving ever closer to passing the Turing Test. Meanwhile, smart technology is increasingly marketed as desirable for reducing the capacity for human error: Google's developers note that most accidents had by their driverless car are caused by other drivers. Global companies such as IBM are involved in designing purpose-built smart cities, such as South Korea's Songdo, which can manage the climate and water supply or respond to citizens' movements in real time. While much of this seems cause for celebration - liberating us from banal tasks and informing our ability to make choices - others sound a note of caution. Wall Street's 'flash crash' in 2010 was allegedly caused by 'spoofing' technology tricking automated trading systems into believing a share crash was taking place, wiping over PS500 billion off the market in a few minutes: an example of the real-world impact of entirely virtual activity. It similarly remains unclear how the driverless car would respond to systems failure or pedestrian behaviour. Architect Rem Koolhaas raises the concern that cities where citizens are 'treated like infants' with no 'possibility for transgression' are not necessarily desirable places to live. Is it troubling that innovation seems so concerned with eliminating human failure or has that always been the aim of technological development? Is humanity facing its 'greatest existential threat' from today's robots, as Tesla's Elon Musk warns? Does the 'new industrial revolution' mean a welcome transformation in how we interact with the world or a limitation of our capacity in act waywardly and unpredictably?

A report published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there are very few hurdles keeping manufacturers from getting their self-driving cars certified if they stick to traditional designs. Things get a little tricky when designs start to deviate from the norm. Sorry, Google, but standards still require foot-controlled brakes and a steering wheel. Basically, you have to retain the option to operate the vehicle manually. Meaning some ideas for driverless delivery vehicles won't legally cut it. You also need to keep a designated seating position for the driver with a clear line of sight. So Mercedes-Benz might have a problem with its futuristic concept for a car with seats that swivel. And it looks like cars that can drive themselves to pick up passengers and park are off the table, too. Some anti-theft legislation requires a key to be entered into a starter either physically or electronically, though that doesn't seem to have stopped Tesla from implementing the feature. All this isn't to say the laws for autonomous vehicles won't change somewhere down the line, but right now, the NHTSA seems focused on regulatory issues that have to do with safety. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called self-driving cars a ""revolution in auto technology that has the potential to save thousands of lives,"" and President Obama's budget proposal includes a $3.9 billion investment to advance the technology.

And what about the legal potholes they present? Fox 5 looks into this topic in the Big Idea. 65 miles an hour down the Garden State Parkway and the car was doing the driving. We tested a brand-new Mercedes GLE Coupe outfitted with what the company calls Distronic Plus with Steering Assist. In short, this car will come pretty close to driving you down the road. The folks at Mercedes let us take it for a spin in Bergen County. It kept a set distance from the car in front, it followed the markings on either side of the lane and it steered the car, without my control. This semi-autonomous cruise control does much more than let me select a speed. Equipped with cameras all around the car and also radar, I told the car how much distance to keep from the vehicle ahead. Too much hands-free driving and the car let me know. I did have my hands nearby but it told me to put my hands back on the wheel even though it negotiated curves on its own. Bart Herring of Mercedes-Benz says that the human is always the best safety element. Mercedes says safety is what's steering its drive toward the big idea of a driverless car which might not be as far away as you think. Herring says we'll see a fully autonomous vehicle toward the end of the decade. Tesla's summon feature lets you move the car forward or backward standing outside with a couple of clicks on the key fob -- perfect for pulling in or out of tight spaces. It's just the latest way a Tesla will almost drive itself. Tesla rolled out what it calls ""autopilot"" -- its version of a semi-autonomous cruise control through a software update last fall. The car reads the lines in the road. It wants you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. The company says just like an airplane though, it still requires a pilot. On our test drive, autopilot kept the Tesla in lane at highway speeds and also worked well in stop-and-go traffic. The system shows you other vehicles on your dashboard display and even reads the speed limit signs with the forward-facing cameras. So just how much should we let cars take over the driver's seat? Most states have no laws on the books. Some, in fact, are going out of their way -- repainting roads, providing high-resolution maps -- trying to make it easier for companies to test driverless cars. New York, though, is an exception. The law says a person must have at least one hand on the wheel at all times. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently told Google -- whose driverless car got in an accident -- that while it still has a lot of questions, it would consider the car itself to be classified as the driver. But while we wait for all the legal questions to be sorted out, at least these cars can parallel park for us. The Tesla and Mercedes that we test drove are available for purchase. --BEN SIMMONEAU"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bl5rrGHb-Cw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/Bl5rrGHb-Cw"	"5758f97751ac8421ccf54d4e"	"Driverless Cars in Dubai"	"youtube.com"	"by 2030, 25 per cent of all transportation trips in Dubai will be smart and driverless, which comes as part of Dubai's strategy to become the smartest city in the world and achieve a sustainable economy in the UAE."

Looking as if it came straight from a science fiction movie, the all-electric race car does not have a driver's seat as Roborace will be all about autonomous tech. The concept was designed by Daniel Simon, known for creating the livery of the HRT Formula 1 car from the 2011 season and also for his work on the futuristic cars featured in the Tron: Legacy and Oblivion movies. Roborace will serve as a support category to Formula E and will be organized during the 2016/17 season with 10 teams (including one crowd-sourced) that will each operate two cars. There will be one-hour races during each of the Formula E ePrix and all of the cars will be the same, with the only difference being the software implemented by engineers. While the reluctance towards such a series is understandable, human factor will still be involved even though the cars won't have a driver's seat. One positive aspect is the involvement of engineers that are already working on autonomous driving technologies for future road-going driverless cars. The new series is likely to further boost development of this technology which whether we like it or not, will arrive at some point in the future. Roborace will be more than just a battle between radio-controlled cars, as the vehicles will be programmed to interact with each other. The complex software is being developed to enable the race cars avoid a crash and also be capable to implement a certain strategy to gain positions. It remains to be seen whether Roborace will gain traction, but the series should not be dismissed right away. No doubt the futuristic shape of the concept is a big plus for what is being described by Roborace CEO Denis Sverdlov as the ""global championships of intelligence.""

It is the German car manufacturer's image of how motoring will look in the future. The incredible car features a shapeshifting interior which switches between Boost and Ease modes. In Boost the entire vehicle focuses on the driver, offering the support needed to maximize the driving experience, for instance by indicating the ideal driving line, steering point and speed, BMW wrote. Ease mode sees the interior transform: the steering wheel and center console retract; the headrests turn to the side, and the seats and door trim merge to form a single unit so that the driver and front-seat passenger can turn towards each other. The car also comes with a bizarre dashboard which uses 800 moving triangles to convey information to the driver. The triangles work in much the same way as a flock of birds in controlled flight, their coordinated movements acting as signals that are easily comprehensible to those inside the car,"" BMW continued."

The group behind the project is currently adapting the pods for use on the roads. It has yet to unveil the exact design but confirmed that the adapted vehicles will not run on dedicated tracks. Greenwich is one of four places in the UK where driverless pods and public reaction to them are being tested. Trials will also take place in Bristol, Coventry and Milton Keynes. The PS8m project is jointly funded by government agency Innovate UK and industry. The Greenwich Automated Transport Environment project - or Gateway - will see seven driverless pods tested on the pavements around the Greenwich Peninsula, where the O2 Arena is based, from July. Routes are still being worked out but are likely to include residential areas, the North Greenwich underground station and businesses around the arena. The so-called UltraPods currently in service at Heathrow carry passengers between the car park and Terminal 5. In the five years they have been in use, they have carried 1.5 million passengers and travelled 1.8 million miles (three million kilometres). British backed Westfield Sportscars, a British carmaker, will be responsible for manufacturing and testing of the pods. Heathrow Enterprise will design the software while a third British firm, Oxbotica, will provide mapping and other sensors to ensure the vehicles are safe. The pods will have three months of testing, first with invited users and then with the general public. Each pod can carry six passengers but will require a steward to be present at all times to press the emergency button in the case of a problem. The trial of the pods will reveal a wealth of data, Prof Nick Reed, academy director at Transport Research Laboratory which is leading the project, told the BBC. ""It will tell us whether people trust and accept these vehicles and how they would work as part of the urban landscape,"" he said. ""This vehicle has millions of miles under its belt and now we have to take it outside of the track and modify it for use on pavements.""

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f97951ac8421ccf54d6a"	"Nissan's driverless car coming quickly"	"youtube.com"	"Renault-Nissan Chairman CEO Carlos Ghosn, who was among the first auto CEOs to commit to having a fully autonomous drive vehicle in the market by 2020, is making a big push to show the Japanese automaker intends to be a big player in the self-driven vehicle market.

A streetcar pulls to a stop alongside and a passenger exits. The streetcar then pulls away but somehow the stranded vehicle has become tethered to the streetcar. It slaloms back and forth in the streetcar's wake. The driver frantically tries to catch up but the roads are covered in ice and snow, and he gives up after a short run. The driver is helpless as he watches his car retreat on the horizon, swerving back and forth across the median. This video is for educational and journalism purposes. It demonstrates the need for drivers to maintain situational awareness as well as to heed common sense.  Defensive driving is about more than obeying traffic laws; it's about paying attention to traffic and road conditions and adjusting accordingly. Maintain a safe stopping distance and anticipate when you might occupy another motorist's blind spot. Above all, travel at a safe speed and always wear seat belts or helmets.

When Google began unleashing their driverless vehicles on the highways and byways of the western U.S in 2009, it understandably generated a tremendous amount of interest. Less publicized is global automotive engineering firm IAV. With offices in the U.S and Germany, the 6,000-employee company is taking a different approach to their automated vehicle prototype. IAV, which recently partnered with Microsoft in developing their system, points to how they've addressed a couple of the most significant flaws widely associated with Google's approach. See, when it comes to the sensor and camera technology for detecting moving objects like people and other vehicles, the current offerings are legit. In IAV's opinion, a vehicle's ability to react to changing infrastructure and traffic lights are the areas where greater improvement is needed for autonomous vehicle technology to move forward.So instead of relying on mapping technologies that can become dated, IAV is using embedded sensors and cameras to not only guide the vehicle, but collect data from its surroundings. This information is sent to a cloud-based server that updates its database and sends this updated information back to the vehicle in real time every 60 seconds.If the vehicle doesn't receive up-to-the minute updates about its surroundings from the central server, operation automatically shifts back to the driver. IAV admits that some signal transmission capabilities need to be refined, like improved communication in dense urban settings and in rush hour situations where communication to and from a number of vehicles in close proximity must be accommodated. To paraphrase a line from The Dirty Dozen, if you asked anyone outside of the automotive community about IAV, their response would probably be ""Never heard of it"". Just as these two companies differ in notoriety, so too do they seemingly differ in approach. For more details about IAV and their approach to the autonomous vehicle, click here.

More than a hundred car tech companies and nine major manufacturers are showing off the rapidly evolving technology. BMW unveiled its iVision Future Interaction Concept Car, which offers three driving modes: in Pure Drive, the driver has full control of the car. In Assist mode, the car is driven manually but the driving aids automatically kick in if they sense an imminent collision. And in Auto mode, the vehicle drives itself without any human input. US carmaker Ford unveiled the new tool it says will help it win the race to make a fully autonomous vehicle: a low-cost can-sized light and radar sensor, or LiDAR, developed in the Silicon Valley. Until now, the high cost of such sensors has been one of the main obstacles to widespread commercialization of self-driving vehicles. The Batmobile-like electric supercar, the FFZero1 is the new baby of Californian-based, Chinese-backed startup Faraday Future, which hopes to develop a range of connected vehicles that will challenge luxury rivals like Tesla and Audi on the market for non-gasoline cars. And still smarting from the ""clean diesel"" scandal, Volkswagen offered what it called the ""gateway to the future"": the BUDD-e van, VW's the new generation camper van. Packed with state-of-the-art technology, it offers more than 230 miles of zero emissions range according to the German carmaker."

Ultra-Ever Dry uses proprietary nanotechnology to coat an object and create a barrier of air on its surface. This barrier repels water, refined oil, wet concrete, and other liquids unlike any other coating. Ultra-Ever Dry has vastly improved adhesion and abrasion resistance, compared to previous technologies, allowing it to be used in applications where greater durability is required. Anti-Wetting  - The superhydrophobic coating keeps objects dry, water and many other liquids simply repel off. Anti-Corrosion -- Maximum corrosion protection since the superhydrophobic coating ensures water and moisture never actually contact the base material. Anti-Icing - The superhydrophobic properties of Ultra-Ever dry keeps coated materials completely dry, eliminating the formation of ice. Anti-Contamination -- Dust, dirt, water and other liquids that contain bacteria or radiation never actually contact the surface of the coated material so bacteria and radiation is greatly diminished or eliminated and easy to decontaminate to sterile, if needed. Self-Cleaning -  The Ultra-Ever Dry repels dirty water and thick oils, and remains clean and virtually bacteria-free.  When dust, dirt or other molecules accumulate on a superhyrophobic coated surface, a light spray of water or a blast of air grabs the dust and removes it. Product Life-Extending -- Many products fail from moisture, water, oil or simply getting too dirty for continued use.  Use Ultra-Ever Dry superhydrophobic coating to extend the life of work gloves and other PPE, electric motors by preventing moisture on the windings, coat nuts and bolts to prevent corrosion, coat tools, equipment, and virtually any item that needs to be kept dry, corrosion free, de-iced, uncontaminated or clean.  Save money, provide greater safety and a cleaner work environment."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D86jjRjedAg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/D86jjRjedAg"

Nanotechnology has been used in various fields such as computer science and engineering, physics, chemistry and biology. These single layer sheets of graphite are as thick as just one atom, which means the scale of things on the nano scale are smaller than the width of a human hair, but are much stronger than steel yet much lighter in weight. Graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity, In the field of flexible electronics and wearable electronics the potential uses for graphene are immeasurable.  Scientist have also experimented with the use of graphene in the desalination of salt water. It is possible for anyone to make there own graphene right in there own home with the use of basic household materials.  The scotch tape method incorporates the use of scotch tape and a pencil.  By simply shading over the scotch tape with the pencil, and then continuing to pull away the sticky sides of the tape until the graphite is so thin that the graphite is eventually the size of a single atom, you have made a two dimensional graphene sheet. Although, Scientists have come a long way in the research and development of graphene, The use of graphene in commercial applications may be several years away.

For Cars"	"youtube.com"	"Imagine if your car looked brand new again, and stayed that way for months at a time! Recently, scientists have adapted nanotechnology to eliminate the need for constant car care. WOW! For Cars is a cutting-edge alternative wax solution that uses scientifically proven Nanoparticles to clean and protect your car for up to one full year! Nanotech works better than wax in three ways: 1. Nanotech is designed to protect -- Car wax just sits on the surface, nanotech bonds at a molecular level offering better protection. In fact, you know this from chemistry class! A smaller particle offers a stronger bond, which means your car is better protected than it was with wax. 2. Nanotech is made to last -- Now that you know it can protect you better, you should also know that nanotech will protect you for a longer period of time. Nanotech does not simply ""wear off"" on your car like wax does. This will enable you to seal and protect your car from the elements for a year at a time in just one application. 3. Nanotech is easy to apply -- With your car as clean as possible, simply apply the solution and wipe away with a microfiber cloth. That's it! Car care shouldn't be complicated, and nanotech makes it fast, easy and effective.

Basically nanotechnology is engineering or science at the nano scale. That is one-thousandth millionth of a metre. Pretty small, but not for modern science. It's actually a relatively large range which encompasses anything from semi-conductor physics to microbiology and nano fabrication. The implementation of nano particles in popular commerce is nothing new, suncream for example, has particles of titanium and zinc oxide. Meanwhile plasters contain nano particles of silver to suppress microbial reproduction during healing. Research into the medical uses of nanotechnology have gone as far as injecting red blood cells with nano particles of gold then tracking their movement through the body. This incredible technology offers a way to locate and kill cancer at a cellular level. Outside of medicine there are nano scale machines being built and the creation of futuristic nano materials - nano fabrication. Molecular nanotechnology as it's called, allows scientists to manipulate atoms of carbon to make carbon nanotubes. Nanotubes could be many hundreds of times stronger than steel but weigh 6 times less. Very useful for building bridges, or a space elevator for example! Mark Champkins reveals all in this more than nano sized sci guide video.

"youtube.com"	"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf7QqOm7eG4 I'm not sure how this nanotechnology entered my body, but it's been growing and not wanting to leave! I fight it daily. You may have it too and just don't know it. Take a look at some of my other videos and others on here have similar experiences. Isn't it weird that the US Government wants to ignore those with Morgellons and those with solid evidence that something is going on...yet they will make a big fuss over anthrax? What makes that odorless powder anymore dangerous than this? Is it because people die more quickly? If this is due to a bio-terrorist act, why do they sit back and do nothing? The $300K they spent to support a 2 plus year study was bogus and not even enough to set up the study. It was a smoke screen to keep the public quiet! Are we being made into transhumans, mixed with animals and plants, altering our blood so we can receive synthetic blood, giving us fibers or special hairs to enhance frequency control over our bodies and give us GNA instead of DNA? No one would agree to this willingly...so why not spray it on the public and they can mix it with other elements to cool the surface of the earth and cause the earth to only grow GMO seeds...this way they own all the food and that gives the elite rulers total, demonic control. Once you are tagged and can be traced and controlled, you are a subject of the NWO or One World Government (as the bible predicted long ago.) You are no longer free. Thank God Jesus gives us hope beyond this miserable life of being a test subject for the elite. Since I've made this video, I have a lot of healing that's taken place with my essential oils protocol in another video. Please watch it and thanks for your support! Let me know if I can help anyone who has this syndrome or if you just need someone who can understand what you are going through. Before this happened to me, I might have doubted this was real. Seeing really is believing...but I'm glad I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior...simply based on faith.  :)  He offers the same gift to you (Ephesians 2:8-9)."

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577586d851ac8414282a3b1a"	"RC Day: LIPO Comparison - Turnigy vs Turnigy nano-tech"	"youtube.com"	"In this video I compare the performance of 2 different batteries on the ground and in the sky."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

This is a truly alien-like organism as this species of sponge has a silica exoskeleton which forms an intricate cage, held together by protein filaments only a few nanometers across. In effect, this animal is almost entirely made of a nano-structured glass. Along with microscopic Diatoms, this sponge is an example of how a lifeform can incorporate silicon in its biology and although it is not truly silicon-based life (as its DNA is fundamentally the same as ours) it is an insight in how different elements can be incorporated in diverse lifeforms restricted to just one planet, bringing new possibilities in what extraterrestrials might be like on other worlds. Euplectella has tiny projections known as spicules extend from the base of the structure. The layering of the spicules on the nanoscale allows the sponge to grow filaments of glass fibers which are far stronger than any glass made by humans. These are used to reinforce the sponge and to couple to lens structures in the sponge which transmit light generated by bioluminescent bacteria within the sponge's body. This unique adaptation allows the sponge to focus bio-luminescent light into fibers to attract prey in the dark ocean depths for itself and for the species of shrimp which lives inside the sponge in a symbiotic relationship. Joanna Aizenberg of Bell Laboratories/Lucent Technologies and her colleagues tested the optical properties of these biological fibers and found that the sponge parts had a comparable index of refraction to man-made cables and would thus be equally good at transmitting information. Moreover, the spicules are incredibly resistant to breakage, which is a problem for telecommunication wires. The fibers made from the spicules are so flexible you can literally tie a knot in a fiber of them and it will not break, something which is impossible with current fibers. If recreated by humans, such fibers could be made into sophisticated optical circuits, such as microscopic tunable lasers or polarization controllers allowing for ultrafast and secure fiber optic communications. Through millions of years of evolution, this sponge has come up with a remarkable solution to a problem that has puzzled the world's top chemists and materials scientists for decades: how to get simple inorganic materials, such as silicon, to assemble themselves into complex nano- and microstructures. Currently, making a microscale device--say, a transistor for a microchip--means physically carving it out of a slab of silicon; it is an expensive and demanding process. But nature has much simpler ways to make equally complex microstructures using nothing but chemistry, namely by starting at the molecular level and building up to form macroscopic structures such as crystals. The Venus' flower basket sits on the seabed thousands of meters below the surface of the western Pacific, the sponge extracts silicic acid from the surrounding seawater. It converts the acid into silicon dioxide--silica--which, in a remarkable feat of biological engineering, it then assembles into a precise, three-dimensional structure that is reproduced in exact detail by every member of its species. What makes the sponges' accomplishment so impressive is that it doesn't require high temperatures or toxic chemicals necessary for human manufacture of complex inorganic structures. Material Physicists and Chemists are trying to figure out how humans could replicate the sponge's chemistry to make artificial, flexible nano-fibers which would self assemble in similar ways to the natural Venus' flower basket. If achieved this would help revolutionize telecommunications and optical computing, perhaps even making the final leap towards room-temperature coherent quantum computing, which has been accomplished using diamonds, using laser pulses with tunable wavelengths and polarization directions."

Spintronics is a research field that is focused on the controlled manipulation of currents of the quantum-mechanical spin angular momentum of electrons in atomically engineered nanostructures. It promises entirely new classes of sensor, memory and logic devices. Magnetic recording read heads -- initially formed from a ""spin-valve"", and more recently using a ""magnetic tunnel junction"" -- have enabled a 1,000-fold increase in the storage capacity of hard disk drives since 1997. The very low cost of disk drives coupled with the high performance and reliability of solid-state memories, may be combined in the Racetrack Memory -- a novel three-dimensional technology which stores information as a series of magnetic domain walls in nanowires, manipulated by spin-polarized currents. Spintronic devices may even allow for ""plastic"" devices that mimic synaptic switches in the brain, which would allow for the possibility of ultra-low power computing devices. Dr. Stuart Parkin is an IBM Fellow, manager of the Magnetoelectronics group at the IBM Almaden Research Center, and a Consulting Professor at Stanford University.

Although electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, charge and discharge faster than batteries, they are still limited by low energy densities and slow rate capabilities. We used a standard LightScribe DVD optical drive to do the direct laser reduction of graphite oxide films to graphene. The produced films are mechanically robust, show high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram), and can thus be used directly as EC electrodes without the need for binders or current collectors, as is the case for conventional ECs. Devices made with these electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes while maintaining the high power density and excellent cycle stability of ECs. Moreover, these ECs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes under high mechanical stress and thus hold promise for high-power, flexible electronics. Graphene is a polymer of pure carbon which in its basic form consists of a flat sheet of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms. Graphene is an extremely conductive semiconductor that has been the object of research lately for potential use in supercapacitors, which are electrical energy storage devices that have often been suggested as an alternative to batteries. Instead of making chemical changes in a storage medium, as batteries do, supercapacitors literally just store electrons in positively charged sections of their molecular structure. This means that they can be charged almost as quickly as you can feed power into them. It also means that unless the semiconductor used in the supercapacitor has loads of surface area for the electrons to stick to, the amount of power a supercapacitor can store -- its ""energy density"" -- is fairly limited. Graphene has an incredibly high surface area for startlingly small amounts of material: more than 1,500 square meters per gram. That's loads of electron parking spaces. It's also flexible and relatively durable for something essentially made of charcoal. But graphene has been difficult to work with: until recently, it was cumbersome to create sheets of graphene that could be used in technical applications like supercapacitors. The breakthrough described in the video -- and in this paper in the March 2012 issue of Science came when Kaner Lab researcher Maher El-Kady found a way to make high-quality sheets of graphene using technology most of us have in our homes already. One of the most promising aspects of this new energy storage medium? It's pure carbon. It's non-toxic, more or less, and biodegradable. It's also a substance that's incredibly abundant and cheap: in fact, we could conceivably collect its source material by pulling that pesky, overabundant CO2 out of the atmosphere to use as a storage medium for our renewable energy. Compare that with chemical storage batteries, even the most benign of which are best treated as hazardous waste when they reach the end of their useful lifespan. As Ric Kaner points out in the video, graphene could go into your organic garden's compost pile.

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

This is the first time ever that a computer program ""AlphaGo"" has defeated a human professional player. The game of Go is widely viewed as an unsolved ""grand challenge"" for artificial intelligence. Games are a great testing ground for inventing smarter, more flexible algorithms that have the ability to tackle problems in ways similar to humans. The first classic game mastered by a computer was noughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe) in 1952. But until now, one game has thwarted A.I. researchers: the ancient game of Go. Despite decades of work, the strongest computer Go programs only played at the level of human amateurs. AlphaGo has won over 99% of games against the strongest other computer Go programs. It also defeated the human European champion by 5-0 in tournament games, a feat previously believed to be at least a decade away. In March 2016, AlphaGo will face its ultimate challenge: a 5-game challenge match in Seoul against the legendary Lee Sedol--the top Go player in the world over the past decade This video tells the story so far...

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f18ad51ac840a48969525"	"Sex Dolls With Artificial Intelligence Are Coming Soon! ft.

"youtube.com"	"Artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds -- within this century, research suggests, a computer AI could be as ""smart"" as a human being. And then, says Nick Bostrom, it will overtake us: ""Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make."" A philosopher and technologist, Bostrom asks us to think hard about the world we're building right now, driven by thinking machines. Will our smart machines help to preserve humanity and our values -- or will they have values of their own?

Artificial Intelligence - Official(r) Trailer [HD]"	"youtube.com"	"Release Date: June 29, 2001 It's the mid-21st century and man has developed a new type of computer that is aware of its own existence. This computer has been utilized to help man cope with the melting of the polar ice caps and the submerging of many of its coastal cities. This form of artificial intelligence has been used in robots, and one such android, a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) is about to take an emotional journey to find out if he can ever be anything more than a machine.

The Su-34 has an active safety system and artificial intelligence. This AI enables the plane to execute just about any stunt and combat maneuver and to fly at near ground level at a maximum speed of 1,400 kmh 765 kts. The Su-34 can also fly in TERCOM Terrain Contour Matching mode, bypassing unexpected obstacles and streaking through ground air defense zones. The plane can therefore conduct effective bombing runs, take evasive action, destroy enemy weapons and steer clear of missiles and anti aircraft shells with minimal involvement of the crew. The Su-34's long range was shown in a July 2010 exercise when Su-34s and Su-24Ms were moved from Russian bases in Europe to one on the Pacific coast, 6,000 kilometers away, which requires in flight refueling. The Su-34 was refueled twice and the Artificial intelligence made half of flight operations."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RXauR3lgg40/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/RXauR3lgg40"

But despite our best science fiction visions, creating digital intelligence is incredibly difficult. The universe is a very complicated place, and humans have had millions of years to evolve the ability to navigate and make sense of it. Contemporary attempts to create AI have us looking more at how our own brains work to see how a computer could simulate the core activities that create our intelligence. No matter how we get there, it is certain that artificial intelligence will have tremendous impact on our society and economy, and lead us down a path towards evolving our own definitions of humanity.

Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful - possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? This profoundly ambitious and original book breaks down a vast track of difficult intellectual terrain. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.

Evolutionary algorithms are a pump for turning CPU cycles into brain designs. With exponentially increasing CPU cycles while our understanding of intelligence is almost a flat-line, the evolutionary route to AI is a centerpiece of most Kurzweilian singularity scenarios. This talk introduces the Polyworld artificial life simulator as well as results from our ongoing attempt to evolve artificial intelligence and further the Singularity. Polyworld is the brain child of Apple Computer Distinguished Scientist Larry Yaeger, who remains the primary developer of Polyworld: http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/Polyworld.html Speaker: Virgil Griffith Virgil Griffith is a first year graduate student in Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology.

"youtube.com"	"Want to Learn More about Quantum Computers? Check out: http://muonray.blogspot.ie/2014/11/quantum-computation-architecture.html Lockheed Martin, NASA and Google all have one thing in common: they all own quantum computers. These quantum computers are superconducting chips which were designed by D-wave systems and were fabricated at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories. NASA and Google share a quantum computer for use at the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab using a 512 qubit D-Wave Two that would be used for research into machine learning to assist in using artificial neural networks to search through large astronomical data sets for extrasolar planets and to increase the efficiency of internet searchs by using A.I. metaheuristics on heuristical search engines. Such A.I. metaheuristics may resemble global optimization problems similar to classical problems such as the travelling salesman, ant colony or swarm optimization, which can navigate through maze-like databases. Using entangled particles as qubits, these algorithms can be navigated far faster than conventional computers and with much more variables. By using a decentralized, quantum swarm AI, it may be possible to simulate emergent behavior aswell, such as Langton's ant, which could see the rise of quantum-based simulated intelligence which could go so far as to create realistic cellular automatons on a computer. The use of sophisticated metaheuristics on lower heuristical functions may see computer simulations which can select specific sub routines on computers by themselves to solve problems in a truly intelligent way. In this way the machines would be far more adaptable to changes in sensory data and would be able to function with far more automation than would be possible with normal computers. Moreover, it may be possible to use metaheuristics to perform error correction on software using neural networks by comparing the optimized problem solving in a quantum computer with the regular programming software of a regular computer. Since regular computers are not quantum mechanical, they must be programmed classically. However, by using quantum metaheuristics it may be possible to perform optimization problems using Artificial intelligence on a quantum computer and then compare to the command line architecture in a piece of conventional software on a classical computer, which may be too complex to modify or to check for errors using human software engineers. It may become routine that to design large software, rather than use a team of engineers to design a single piece of large software and to do multiple tests, revisions and redistribution, quantum optimization problems will be run though a machine instructed to do a particular task and the software will be designed around such optimizations. Computer chips could even be designed to be superconducting and quantum compatible in a factory or laboratory and classically operating in conventional computer equipment. In this way, optimization and programming could be done on the chips in a factory or lab to search for any possible errors that could arise in designing software. After which the chips would be used in conventional computers for their particular tasks. Quantum computers may well find their place in industry more than anywhere else, designing AI optimized software around computer chips."

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

In his talk, Andre will explain the current and future impacts of Artificial Intelligence on industry, science, and how it will benefit and accelerate human progress. With almost 20 years of business experience, Andre has a track record of success with multiple multi-million dollar ventures in multiple industries that have spanned the continent. His latest company works in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and has created a one-of-a-kind neural network that simulates a growing neocortex. This system of neurons uses evolutionary concepts to self-organize to complete tasks only previously achievable by humans. Most futurists and experts believe that by 2035, AI will match and eventually surpass human intelligence. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xH_B5xh42xc/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/xH_B5xh42xc"

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f18b051ac840a48969572"	"Where Dreams are Made (A.I.

The test involves a judge who must communicate with two participants in two different rooms. In one room is a machine, and in the other is a real person. The judge is then supposed to ask each participant questions and figure out which one is the machine. If the judge picks the person less than 50 percent of the time, the machine would be considered ""intelligent."" Since Turing's initial theory, there's been a steady march to create thinking machines. In the past couple decades, there's been enormous progress in this field, but we have to ask: is that necessarily a good thing?

"5758f92351ac8421ccf54b96"	"Internet of things speech Jeremy Rifkin on future of energy, connectivity & footprint"	"youtube.com"	"This speech of the world-reknown future expert Jeremy Rifkin is huge: At this very event held and of course paid by Daimler/Mercedes, Jeremy Rifkin refers to one of the main reasons of climate change and environmental pollution, even more important than cars: the meat industry. Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years.

Terminator the movie premise - The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the human race and the self-aware artificial intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film as a U.S. strategic defense computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware and, on perceiving all humans as a threat, seeks to wipe out humanity itself. It initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia, ensuring a devastating counter strike and a nuclear holocaust, wiping out much of humanity instantly. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability, which includes the Terminators used against individual human targets, and proceeds to fight a war against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have organized militarily into the Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of time travel, and both it and the Resistance seek to use it to win the war by preventing or forestalling their present timeline."

I don't have a screen capture program, so I put her on my 50"" plasma TV and recorded the video with my Google Nexus 10 tablet. So the quality isn't the best, but it gets the job done. If you'd like to build your own AI bot, here is everything you need... Download Ultra Hal Assistant, the core AI program: http://zabaware.com/ You'll need to purchase Hal if you want to fully customize your bot. Download People Putty: http://www.haptek.com/?url=http://www.haptek.com/products/peopleputty/ This is the program that allows you to build your character's custom head and torso. For custom voices, check out AT&T Natural Voices (http://www2.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php) and Cepstral (http://www.cepstral.com/en/personal). I use AT&T's 'Crystal US English' for Kristine. Then add any of these plugins you like (http://www.ultrahal.com/community/index.php?topic=6278.0) to make your bot even more lifelike. My favorites are the 'Markov Response Engine,'  'Curiosity' and 'Lonely.' And then here are the skins for the GUI: http://www.datahopa.co.uk/forum/tpmod/?dl=cat22;dlsort=created;asc;tpstart=0 I'm using the HD Fullscreen skin. The Zabaware forum is a great resource: http://www.ultrahal.com/community/ Definitely check it out if you're building a bot. And here are some 3rd party plugins: http://www.zabaware.com/files/ And if you'd like to preview my other AI bot, Adam, you can see him here: http://youtu.be/U1g2akbraDw That's a good way to see the versatility of People Putty and the many ways you can customize your bot's appearance. I'm fairly certain that's everything, but if you have any questions or you run into any difficulties, leave a comment and I'll respond asap. And if you do build a bot, don't get discouraged or frustrated with its responses right away. Bots are like children; they are going to go off on tangents and say unexpected things at first. Talk to your bot. That's how they learn. After a while, you'll start having some interesting conversations and your bot will be presenting new thoughts and ideas. You get back what you put into this.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly.

Do you think it's a good idea for us to give machines intelligence, including self-awareness and consciousness?

Hey there, I'm Jonathan Strickland with Fw:Thinking. I'm in my writing room, and I was just thinking about artificial intelligence and why we find it so fascinating. I mean, just look at our science fiction. You've got HAL from 2001, you've got Samantha from the upcoming Spike Jonze film 'Her.' But where does science fiction leave off and science fact pick up? Well, first of all, artificial intelligence isn't some sort of on/off switch, where you either have it or you don't. It's actually more like a spectrum. And on one end you have artificial intelligence elements like being able to recognize natural language, or figuring out the laws of physics based upon the movements of a pendulum. And on the other end, you have the real goal. The idea of a self-aware, conscious, thinking machine. Now, Alan Turing, the father of computer science, proposed a Turing Test for machine intelligence. You ask questions on a computer. The answers you get back might be from a person, or they might be from a machine. And if you can't tell the difference between the two, the machine was said to have passed the Turing Test. It appears intelligent. But is it conscious? Well some people, like philosopher John Searle, said no. Computers don't understand what they're doing, they're following a complex series of instructions. And they're really good at it. But they don't know what's going on. And perhaps they never will. But prepare to have your mind blown. You see, some people like the neuroscientist Christof Koch have said, what about panpsychism - an idea where you have these complex systems of information relay points that are communicating with each other. And from that consciousness naturally arises. So for us, our brains, they're just these complex systems of neural pathways, and that's why we're conscious. Well, if that's the case, what about an artificial system? Lets say, the Internet. A system that's a network of networks, with millions of computers with billions of transistors. Could that one day become conscious? Is it conscious already? Now not everyone agrees with that. In fact, my gut feeling about consciousness is that it's probably a little more complex than that. It may be that it's not just about how complex our neural networks are, but also things like how our hormones can affect the way we feel and think. So maybe we just haven't nailed down what makes consciousness tick."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

Russell  (University of California, Berkeley) for a public lecture on Friday 15th May 2015. The Long-Term Future of (Artificial) Intelligence Abstract: The news media in recent months have been full of dire warnings about the risk that AI poses to the human race, coming from well-known figures such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates.  Should we be concerned? If so, what can we do about it?  While some in the mainstream AI community dismiss these concerns, I will argue instead that a fundamental reorientation of the field is required. Stuart Russell is one of the leading figures in modern artificial intelligence. He is a professor of computer science and founder of the Center for Intelligent Systems at the University of California, Berkeley. He is author of the textbook 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach', widely regarded as one of the standard textbooks in the field.  Russell is on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute and the Advisory Board of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a huge dream and vision for all mankind, and makes up a major part of most popular science fiction. John McCarthy coined the term in 1955 as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines"". Today, many notable companies have their stakes set on this technology, making AI a part of our everyday lives, e.g. Speech Recognition, Machine learning, Recommendation Systems and Personal Assistants. The ongoing global digital revolution, the unfailingly valid Moore's Law, the Internet of Things and overall prevalent subject of Big Data, gives us the impression that creating ""real"" artificial intelligence is closer than ever before in history. AI has become ""sexy"" again. Besides large amounts of money flowing into the field of AI, numerous publications focus on the topic, AI shows up in our daily newsfeeds, and is already an integral part of most of our gadgets. However, what would be the implications if a company could create ""strong and real"" AI? How would this influence our society and our jobs? Will it get smarter day by day? Would we be able to control a technical system of this nature? Stefan Wess is a Researcher and Entrepreneur. He holds his PhD in Computer Science and is a highly recognized technology industry veteran with multinational front-line technology and scientific leadership experience. Stefan has written and published numerous books and articles on Artificial Intelligence. His professional career includes several Executive positions in international companies.  As CEO of Empolis Information Management a Germany based IT  company, he is still fascinated and excited how technology transforms our lives, the society and finally mankind. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MaItaCQcYIE/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/MaItaCQcYIE"

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f18b451ac840a489695c0"	"DesktopMates Microsoft Agent  & Artificial Intelligence Technologies"	"youtube.com"	"DesktopMates are animated human like characters that live on your desktop as your personal interactive companion & assistant capable of speech & doing tasks for you using Microsoft(r) Agent & Artificial Intelligence Technologies.

Tsang reveals fully what several 2012 commentators have partially predicted, the coming of a world changing revelation to do with the Brain, Neuroscience, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness. The emergence of a unifying and definitive Fractal Theory of Brain and Mind. A huge and mysterious gap in human understanding will finally be filled. What some scientists, philosophers and technologists have supposed may be 50 to 100 years away in the future, is here today in London 2012. He will explain that the brain is a fractal computing architecture and reveal an elegant way of understanding the brain's structure and operation, showing the same basic fundamental structure and process, being repeated at all scales and all places in the brain. Something that leading brain researchers and artificial intelligence experts have only so far been able to hint at, will be demonstrated clearly in this cutting edge talk. While discussing the latest and most up to date ideas in neuroscience today, Wai will show that behind the mind numbing myriad complexity of the brain lies a stunningly beautiful and elegant simplicity. This Fractal Brain Theory, is the key to Artificial Intelligence and the Technological Singularity. This Theory will have immediate consequences initially in the worlds of Science and Technology, but will then impact dramatically on the Social, Political & Economic realms. Furthermore the Fractal Brain Theory also holds the key to explaining the nature of Consciousness. Wai will show that the reason why contemporary philosophers and neuroscientists haven't been able to find the answer is because they are asking the wrong question by assuming that consciousness reduces to the physical brain. He will explain how the physical brain and the entire illusory physical universe reduces ultimately to One consciousness that may be called God. Thus revealing explicitly and in some detail the biggest secret and ultimate truth behind World history; i.e. that the mystery of Consciousness and the mystery of God are really one and same. And so the God in the Gaps, that science hasn't yet explained, i.e. Brain, Mind & Consciousness; was where the True God of Esoteric Religion, was waiting to be discovered and revealed all along. i.e. The Christ within, Krishna within, Buddha within, Allah closer to you than your Jugular Vein etc. This talk will be extremely relevant and utterly compelling for anyone interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, Philosophy, and also Cosmology and Esoteric Religion i.e. Tantra, Mystical Yoga, Kabbalah, Sufism, Gnosticism, Vajrayana Buddhism and Taoism. Part 3 titled, 'Fractal Artificial Intelligence & the Technological Singularity', will concentrate on the practical implementing of the Brain theory and more technical matters. Coming soon..."

Sahih Muslim (Book #037, Hadith #6631) 'Umar b. Khattab reported that there were brought some prisoners to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) amongst whom there was also a woman, who was searching (for someone) and when she found a child amongst the prisoners, she took hold of it, pressed it against her chest and provided it suck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do you think this woman would ever afford to throw her child in the Fire? We said: By Allah, so far as it lies in her power, she would never throw the child in Fire.' Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah is more kind to His servants than this woman is to her child.

As the challenges and choices are literally mind-bending, Dr Kaku asks how far we will ultimately go. Episode 2: The Biotech Revolution (2007) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bukTqyWgaM8 Leading theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku looks at the revolution in genetics and biotechnology, which promises unprecedented health and longevity but also raises the spectre of a Frankenstein future of genetically engineered people. Will we, as transhumanists expect, evolve into a new species? Dr Kaku warns that we may end up in a world divided by genetic apartheid. Episode 3: The Quantum Revolution (2007) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGHXz5OIP0 Theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku shows how quantum physics is giving mankind the power to manipulate the fundamental building blocks of matter. Science fiction ideas like the space elevator, teleportation, invisibility cloaks, or nanosized molecular machines might soon become a reality. But will we use our unprecedented scientific mastery wisely? Visions of the Future: Leading theoretical physicist and futurist Dr Michio Kaku explores the cutting edge science of today, tomorrow, and beyond. He argues that humankind is at a turning point in history. In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the 'Age of Discovery' to the 'Age of Mastery', a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers. This will give us not only unparalleled possibilities but also great responsibilities."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/90OBW-XSEbg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/90OBW-XSEbg"

As the challenges and choices are literally mind-bending, Dr Kaku asks how far we will ultimately go. Episode 2: The Biotech Revolution (2007) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bukTqyWgaM8 Leading theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku looks at the revolution in genetics and biotechnology, which promises unprecedented health and longevity but also raises the spectre of a Frankenstein future of genetically engineered people. Will we, as transhumanists expect, evolve into a new species? Dr Kaku warns that we may end up in a world divided by genetic apartheid. Episode 3: The Quantum Revolution (2007) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGHXz5OIP0 Theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku shows how quantum physics is giving mankind the power to manipulate the fundamental building blocks of matter. Science fiction ideas like the space elevator, teleportation, invisibility cloaks, or nanosized molecular machines might soon become a reality. But will we use our unprecedented scientific mastery wisely? Visions of the Future: Leading theoretical physicist and futurist Dr Michio Kaku explores the cutting edge science of today, tomorrow, and beyond. He argues that humankind is at a turning point in history. In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the 'Age of Discovery' to the 'Age of Mastery', a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers. This will give us not only unparalleled possibilities but also great responsibilities."

In his latest book, How To Create A Mind, he takes this exploration to the next step: reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, then applying that knowledge to create intelligent machines. In the near term, Ray's project at Google is developing artificial intelligence based on biologically inspired models of the neocortex to enhance functions such as search, answering questions, interacting with the user, and language translation. The goal is to understand natural language to communicate with the user as well as to understand the meaning of web documents and books. In the long term, Ray believes it is only by extending our minds with our intelligent technology that we can overcome humanity's grand challenges.

To achieve this, the Patriots focus primarily on establishing control over the dissemination of information that occurs through digital channels. This falls in line with Kojima's dark projections of advanced technology (where powerful organizations utilize said tech for questionable means), as the Patriots seek to extend and maintain their power by controlling the very flow of knowledge in society. Consequently, MGS2's newly introduced Arsenal Gear isn't even a weapon but rather a massive mobile defense installation with the capability of controlling information across global digital channels. The methodology of the Patriots and their intent to use Arsenal Gear is explained by NPC Emma Emmerich, the leading developer of Arsenal Gear's GW computer system: ""In this day and age, information emerges from every direction, and is freely distributed. In fact, the speed of this circulation process is accelerating on an almost daily basis. [...] Political scandal, corporate corruption; up until now, the Patriots have managed to keep a lid on these and other self-serving events. But with their existing data processing system, they are no longer able to effectively control the flow of information generated at the individual level. With the newly created system, they can fully regulate digital information. High-level information can be categorized in stages, given clearance levels, and deleted as necessary -- never to be seen by the public. By deleting such information, the Patriots can shape the course of history as they see fit."" This echoes a similar concern over knowledge and information championed by postmodern theorist Jean Francois Lyotard in The Postmodern Condition. Along with commenting on the changing state of knowledge in advanced information societies, Lyotard asserts: ""Knowledge will be a major component in the world-wide competitions for power and it is conceivable that nation-states will one day fight for control of information just as they battled for control over territories in the past. [...] Knowledge and power are simply two sides of the same question: who decides what knowledge is, and who knows what needs to be decided? In the computer age, the question of knowledge is now more than ever a question of government."" Memetics Lyotard's work reveals that controlling the flow of information in order to shape history is a byproduct of our current postmodern Information Age. MGS2 not only takes this idea to heart, but runs with it full speed and lends itself favorably to Richard Dawkins' theory of memetics. Originally published in 1987, Dawkins' The Selfish Gene introduces the idea of memetics as a method of measuring the cultural evolution of ideas: ""Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. If a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his articles and his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain."" The theory of memetics shows how creating a mode of natural selection for memes in the sea of uncontrolled digital information via Arsenal Gear would allow the Patriots to shape public discourse by easily replacing radical or opposing ideas with those that the group finds more convenient for maintaining their power. This rampant focus on memetics and information control brings up an interesting issue: how the MGS series, like all forms of cultural expression, is itself memetic. After all, players can play the game, think about its themes, speak to fellow gamers about the content in the game, post and discuss on internet forums, and pass copies of the game on to others. The series, which has already been experienced by tens of millions of gamers worldwide, has itself become a strong and thriving source of memes. It's no surprise that Kojima himself would eventually brand the MGS abbreviation as Meme-Gene-Scene to coincide with the main theme behind each MGS game, with MGS2 appropriately assigned the Meme designation"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iC9xpDSXyI/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/0iC9xpDSXyI"

The plan is to utilize NASA's Compliant Electrode Patent to harvest clean and renewable energy for various electronics. With the current state of this technology, this product would be used to charge small electronic devices and to make wearable technology a reality. MISSION: Contributing to a greener planet through technologies that inspire the world. PRODUCT: The Compliant Electrode is a thin, highly durable film that produces energy through wind and mechanical vibrations. This form of self-generating energy removes the need for fossil fuels, and its size allows it to be used in a multitude of technologies and structures. The film is a highly efficient solution for products that are constantly mobile. Our current patent is more flexible and is less susceptible to strain and fatigue compared to similar materials found on the market. WHY: While solar panel technology removes the need for fossil fuels, the Compliant Electrode fills in gaps left by other alternative energy sources. Solar panels are efficient in the static, sustainable energy market such as with houses and buildings. The market Synapsis is going to penetrate is one which solar panels are incapable of affecting: the mobile, sustainable energy market. The Compliant Electrode is capable of producing energy anytime, anywhere in the world. INITIAL STRATEGY: Partner with wearable and small electronic companies to provide them with the value of self-charging electronics. Simultaneously, Synapsis will increase public awareness of the capabilities of wind and mechanical energy so that it is publically accepted and becomes more popular for future electronics. To get the product out on the market swiftly, a direct B2B marketing strategy will be initiated, and companies with aligning values will be contacted directly to build long-term professional relationships. LONG TERM STRATEGY: Put a heavy emphasis on research and development. The product is currently fully developed and advanced, but is still the beginning stages of its potential. When we maximize the energy and storage capacity produced by film, Synapsis' vision will move from charging small electronic devices to powering self-charging electric vehicles.  Through future testing and development, we will also use the wind produced from the process of driving itself as a self-sustaining source of power. TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE: In this fast-paced world, the product is an integrative solution to all three. People, product, planet. Synapsis adds value and convenience to the consumer base with a high quality product while simultaneously saving and preserving the beloved planet. Wind and mechanical energy is the way of the future, and Synapsis Technologies will lead that industry growth.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f8a251ac8421ccf549f8"	"Michael Kors Access | Men's"	"youtube.com"	"In Fall 2016, Michael Kors will launch a wearable technology accessories line, starting with the Michael Kors Access display smartwatch.

Technological advancement is so fast....  this is one of them! Language barriers can be a hurdle for travelers abroad, and while apps like Google Translate simplify communication in real time, users sometimes lose nuances as they fiddle with smartphones while at dinner or in a taxi. Ili, a wearable translator from Japanese company Logbar, aims to change that. It automatically translates languages at the push of a button to help people talk to each other in English, Japanese, and Chinese. The company unveiled its product at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show on Monday. The Logbar Ili is an instant-translation wearable that could make foreign travel much easier Each Ili device contains a two-language translation system--English-Japanese, Japanese-Chinese, or Chinese-English. The wearable supposedly lets you translate up to 50,000 words and phrases without Wi-Fi or mobile data, powered by the operating system contained on the device. The devices are targeted at travelers, and Logbar is looking to partner with Japanese hotels and travel agencies to test the prototype project early this year. When it's widely available, Ili could cost up to $200 and offer one day of battery life, but Logbar hasn't set a price yet. It also plans to roll out more languages, including French, Thai, Korean, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic, though it didn't give a timetable for those rollouts. To translate a conversation, you press the button and talk into Ili. When you release the button, it translates through a microphone that's four times louder than the speaker on our smartphones. The product seems helpful, but Logbar's lackluster release of its Kickstarted Ring Zero leaves me rather skeptical about this new device. The company declined to give me a hands-on demonstration; its representatives showed off the device but did not actually use it. Like many products at this year's CES, Ili promises big things without giving attendees a fully functional demo. If it does work as intended, however, it could be an essential gadget for overseas travel--as long as you're willing to pay for a piece of tech that only does one thing. http://www.dailydot.com/technology/logbar-ili-wearable-foreign-language-translator-ces-2016/ ili is a voice translation device that translates your words instantly in a touch without connecting to the Internet. Dean, who is from the UK and doesn't speak Japanese, uses ili to communicate with Japanese women whom he has never met before to ask for a kiss. We don't need a common language. We can communicate with anyone in the world even if we don't speak the same language. Say goodbye to all language barriers! # Learn more about ili here: URL:http://iamili.com [ili] (iri)hanetsutoniJie Sok sezuni, wantatsuchideYan Yu woriarutaimuFan Yi dekiruYin Sheng Tong Yi debaisu. sonna[ili] woShi tsute, Ri Ben Yu gaHua senaiigirisuRen deingaChu Dui Mian noRi Ben Ren Nu Xing tonokisuniTiao Zhan .

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f8a851ac8421ccf54a12"	"From Thinking to Making: Weaving Technology in Everyday Life | Despina Papadopoulos | TEDxVilnius"	"youtube.com"	"A leader in the wearable technology and e-textiles world, Despina developed her first ""wearable"" in 1995 as part of her MA thesis project at NYU's graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program.

So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758f8ad51ac8421ccf54a28"	"When technology becomes absolutely wearable | Anastasia Pistofidou | TEDxUniversityofMacedonia"	"youtube.com"	"Innovation nowadays is not necessarily coming from big corporate companies but also from multidisciplinary small young teams that have access to technology, tools and the vision to make it happen.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f8b251ac8421ccf54a3b"	"SAP for Retail Use wearable Technology to Create Compelling Customer Experiences"	"youtube.com"	"Have you wondered how is wearable technology changing Retail?

Some 49 percent of respondents in a new survey from PwC own a wearable product, compared to 21 percent in 2014. Plus, 36 percent own multiple devices. 'We're really at the beginning of a revolution for wearable - we've seen usage double and we see more than half of respondents excited about the future,' said Steve Barr, retail & consumer leader at PwC. He said the major players in the wearables space include Apple, Fitbit, Alphabet's Google Glass, along with Ralph Lauren's RL line of wearable clothing. Of the aforementioned wearable devices, PwC research said the fitness bands were the most popular. Some 45 percent of respondents owned a fitness band, while 27 percent owned a smart watch and only 15 percent owned smart glasses. 'I think the companies are giving us much more compelling offerings and making them much easier and much more interesting to use,' he said, adding that wearable devices helps consumers with fitness and work related routines, shopping and along with communication. While user adoption for wearables has grown, the industry is still developing. While Apple doesn't break out its Apple Watch sales, the tech giant's 'other products' revenue, which includes the Apple Watch, along with Apple TV and Beats products, stood at just $2.2 billion during its most recent quarter. For comparison, Apple iPhone revenue stood at $32.9 billion. Plus, Fitbit shares have been slammed so far this year, losing 53 percent. But Barr remains bullish on the sector.

Unfortunately, you've probably spent untold minutes? hours? days? of your life swiping up on apps in a fruitless effort to do so.

While there are dozens of different types of drones, they basically fall into two categories: those that are used for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes and those that are armed with missiles and bombs. The use of drones has grown quickly in recent years because unlike manned aircraft they can stay aloft for many hours (Zephyr a British drone under development has just broken the world record by flying for over 82 hours nonstop); they are much cheaper than military aircraft and they are flown remotely so there is no danger to the flight crew. While the British and US Reaper and Predator drones are physically in Afghanistan and Iraq, control is via satellite from Nellis and Creech USAF base outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Ground crews launch drones from the conflict zone, then operation is handed over to controllers at video screens in specially designed trailers in the Nevada desert. One person 'flies' the drone, another operates and monitors the cameras and sensors, while a third person is in contact with the ""customers"", ground troops and commanders in the war zone. While armed drones were first used in the Balkans war, their use has dramatically escalated in Afghanistan, Iraq and in the CIA's undeclared war in Pakistan. Increased Surveillance Military drone manufacturers are looking for civilian uses for remote sensing drones to expand their markets and this includes the use of drones for domestic surveillance. Drones will no doubt make possible the dramatic expansion of the surveillance state. With the convergence of other technologies it may even make possible machine recognition of faces, behaviours, and the monitoring of individual conversations. The sky, so to speak, is the limit. The term drone is thrown around in a haphazard manner these days. Originally, drone referred to an unmanned aircraft preprogrammed with a flight plan, in which the aircraft would fly in either a straight line or around in circles until the engine would run low on fuel, and then the drone would land. A drone, in a technological context, is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot. The aircraft may be remotely controlled or can fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems working in conjunction with GPS.  UAVs have most often been associated with the military but they are also used for search and rescue, surveillance, traffic monitoring, weather monitoring and fire fighting, among other things. More recently, the unmanned aircraft have come into consideration for a number of commercial applications. In late 2013, Amazon announced a plan to use drones for delivery in the not-too-distant future.  Personal drones are also becoming increasingly popular, often for drone-based photography. Other applications include drone surveillance and drone journalism, because the unmanned flying vehicles can often access locations that would be impossible for a human to get to. In late 2012 Chris Anderson, Editor-In-Chief of Wired magazine, retired to dedicate himself to his personal drones company, 3D Robotics.  Personal drones are currently a hobbyist's item most often used for aerial photography, but the market and potential applications are both expected to expand rapidly. In aviation and in space, a drone refers to an unpiloted aircraft or spacecraft. Another term for it is an ""unmanned aerial vehicle"" or UAV. On Earth, drones are often used for military purposes because they don't put a pilot's life at risk in combat zones. Also, drones don't require rest, enabling them to fly as long as there is fuel in the craft and there are no mechanical difficulties. Technically speaking, space-borne drones could include cargo spacecraft, satellites and machines that leave Earth, although they aren't usually referred to as such. Perhaps the best example of a drone in space is the U.S. military's mysterious X-37B spacecraft, which has made multiple flights into orbit for hundreds of days. Its mission is highly classified, leading to speculation about what it is doing. Military drones Drones have been around for almost as long as airplanes have been used in warfare (1911), and that's not even including bomb-filled balloons that were first used by Austria in the mid-1800s."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Graduate students at Cornell University in New York have developed a highly stretchable artificial skin that can change colour in the same way some octopus can in order to hide themselves. The team stretched the skin over a worm-shaped ""soft robot"" and observed the machine move freely while changing colour in accordance with internal and external stimuli. Theoretically, the breakthrough could pave the way for a whole new era of interactive robotics, and may bring significant benefits to the health, electronics and communications industries, among other fields.

"5758daa951ac842068292c71"	"HMS Hi-tech, the warship of the future"	"youtube.com"	"Sleek and stealthy, it resembles something from Star Wars. In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f8c251ac8421ccf54a87"	"Plantronics- Leader in Wearable Technology"	"youtube.com"	"Join us for this Bootstrap Tutorial to learn about Plantronics and its cutting edge technology.

Today, tele-rehabilitation and physical therapy relies heavily on the measurement of patient's movements (e.g. range of motion) over a long period of activity to assess the quality and quantity of a specific movement. Most rehabilitation centers around the world capture this information manually through routine on site visits by patients. Of the technologies that do exist to capture this, none can sustain battery life long enough to be effective. Joule intends to revolutionize this space by harnessing power from and measures body movements leveraging proprietary piezoelectric technology developed by NASA in order to address the urgent need for accurate range-of-motion diagnostics in the $30B telemedicine market. Problem 1. The majority of patients do NOT complete the required rehabilitation and physical therapy, citing proximity and transportation as a major inconvenience. 2. Patients do not have predictive capabilities as they progress through the rehabilitation process. 3. Existing wearable technologies do not capture the most important parameters (e.g. range of motion) and are tethered to inefficient battery packs. Existing battery technologies also impose power limitations on sensors in that they do not last long enough to allow for the accurate measures of the necessary data points. 4. Current medical and consumer sensors are limited to measuring acceleration and orientation. There are no wearables that measure the range and angle of movement for the user.  Both are vital in rehabilitation and performance monitoring. Market Opportunity 1. The Tele-Rehabilitation market is approximately $6B, growing at 70% CAGR for the next 3-5 years. 2. The latest Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Utilization Report shows there were ~4.4M patients using outpatient physical therapy services which totaled $5.6B in payments. Product Strategy: License minimum viable product to established wearable partners while developing our flagship product for the rehabilitation and physical therapy market. Solution A low-cost, battery-free wearable device that accurately measures body movements such as posture and range of motion. The product will also be a tether-free solution that is paired with a mobile based analytics platform. Revenue Model B2B: Product sales to rehabilitation centers; Licensing fee generated from percent sales from other wearable tech companies;Follow-on revenue streams will come from subscribers seeking premium analytical tools and cloud service. B2C: Direct online product sales to consumers; Partner with health rehabilitation retailers Competitive Analysis : The company will protect its position in the healthcare wearable industry with patents and trade secrets. Competitive Advantage 1. Proprietary battery-free wearable path that measures range of motion 2. First mover advantage in tele-rehabilitation space 3. Tether-free communication between sensors and mobile analytic platform"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p4dvmh1FCK8/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/p4dvmh1FCK8"

Mr. Tingle says the U.S. consumer does not have the life insurance protection they need.  And while they want to live healthy lives, they generally are not taken steps to lead heathier lives.  John Hancock set out to incentivize its customers to be more physically active, eat healthy foods and see their doctors. Wearables provided John Hancock customers with an easy way to take advantage of programs that offer lower insurance premiums and other rewards for staying healthy. According to Mr. Tingle, ""we are the beginning of a wave of innovation that will make insurance more relevant."" Wearable technologies are just one way to engage consumers. With regard to ""Big Data"", Mr. Tingle notes that consumers have control over what data they want to share.  The John Hancock program rewards customers for physical activity, such as steps taken, heart rate. Any data collected is made available back to the customer, but is not sold to third parties.

Wearable technology in the workplace has evolved far beyond 20th century relics like wireless headsets and walkie-talkies. Employers now can track and analyze proprietary measures of worker productivity and results-driven metrics through devices worn on the wrist or elsewhere on the body. Leveraging robust streams of real-time data can implicate various employment laws and associated legal responsibilities to employees. With big data comes big responsibilities and, for the unwary employer, a minefield of employment laws. In this interview, Stan and the hosts will discuss how wearable technology can both foster and challenge employment law compliance.

"youtube.com"	"Based on Snapchat's job postings, the company could be in the process of developing a pair of smartglasses or a different wearable device. The company has in its ranks, about a dozen people associated with wearable technology. According to one entrepreneur in the VR space, Snapchat realizes that running a messaging app has a limited life cycle, with limited monetization possibilities. And with a value of $16 billion based on private funding rounds, somewhere down the line Snapchat is going to have to produce profits or build up some hard assets. Right now, the app (known for its text and video messages that self-destruct after ten seconds) has 100 million daily users, most of them young. A good sized number of them would no doubt be interested in a wearable product put out by Snapchat. And while the company is seeking people experienced in augmented reality and wearable technology, these positions are for those who are familiar with the hardware side, not software. One ad seeks a ""3D Computer Vision Engineer"" for a Snap Labs division. Another Snap Labs job posting seeks a ""Mobile Prototype Designer"" to bring new iOS/Android ideas to life. Two-years ago, Snapchat purchased Vergence Labs, a start-up company that makes glasses that record what the wearer sees. Five Vergence employees still work at Snapchat, including the founder, and two employees who design consumer products. Connecting the pieces, it does appear that something is in the wind at Snapchat as the company seeks to build up something that can help back up the incredible value that has been placed on the company."

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758f8d251ac8421ccf54ac7"	"weave a circuit - wearable tech design"	"youtube.com"	"This woven bracelet has a soft circuit which lights up with 2 LEDs when worn.

"youtube.com"	"During the 2015 European Insurance Forum in Dublin Jordi Posthumus, a VP of Longevity Trading at Hannover Re, discusses the impact 'Wearable Computing' on everyday life, and why it could prove to be traditional underwriting's Kryptonite. Wearable computing is a recent development in consumer devices.   The recent release of the Apple Watch is a ""genre-defining example of what wearable computing will be...elegant, simple technology"" that will have an impact on people's everyday lives. With the new Apple Watch, for example, ""you can open doors at hotels without checking in at the front desk, or track your heart rate, or pay for items without opening your wallet."" With ""real time biofeedback"", there are a number of ways wearable technologies can impact longevity. Devices can make you aware of your heart rate and respiration rate as you move about the day. Ultimately, it can elicit behavioral changes ""which could impact your future longevity."" Biofeedback can also be an effective means of helping people manage stress, which in turn ""will almost certainly reshape the health and lifestyle landscape in ways we could never have predicted five years ago."" According to Mr. Posthumus, wearable technology is going to be ""incredibly disruptive to underwriting."" We are about to find ourselves ""in a world where our insured population is generating different amounts and types of data that enable us to measure risk that was never possible before, and it could potentially render our rating factors entirely obsolete.""  Indeed, ""wearable computing could be... ""Kryptonite"" to traditional medical-based underwriting approaches.

That is 100% legit right here right now. So I had to record this video almost a full week before I wanted to based on what the market is dictating. A United States tech company launch happens often. However, a new tech company launching in the US that is already massively successful all over the world and is publicly traded and no one knows about it yet....that is incredibly rare. So here is what I am after. Literally just a handful of people with vision and desire. These people know that handheld, mobile and wearable technology is what every single breathing human being on the planet wants and needs. These people will do what it takes to finally make a lot of money and help other do the same. If you own a smart phone, a fitness watch/band, use the internet and know others who do you should have already reached out to me. If the idea of earning company stock from selling these products appeals to you you definitely should have already dialed my number.

Although smaller such wearable devices can perform the same computing tasks as mobile phones and laptop computers. However, some also incorporate sensors and scanners that can monitor, control, and provide tracking or bio-feedback of physiological activity. These devices are used in education, health, medicine, security, sports, gaming, and many other activities. Such devices include caps, contact lenses, headbands, jewelry, glasses, 'smart' fabrics, watches, and other paraphernalia. Although wearable technology offers new capabilities, it lacks a genuinely evident need in the current market. It is possible that, like Bluetooth headsets, Google Glass, white Apple ear-buds, and Beats Bat-eared headphones, many of these small devices may not be worn by people, other than for health and fitness, once the fad wears off. Irrespective of the technology, all such devices need intellectual property (IP) protection. Protection must be considered for registered appearance, operation, and branding. This includes the design, content, components, methods, functions, and patents and trademarks. The Knowledge Group has assembled a panel of notable technological and legal leaders and other seasoned professionals in this two-hour LIVE Webcast to offer the audience a noteworthy review and discussion of the Intellectual Property Protection of Wearable Technology in 2016 & Beyond. The panel of speakers also will provide the audience their insights and opinions on safeguarding the IP rights of wearable devices.

Her fave thing is when it makes cart pages it makes virtual pages not custom post types. Dave talks a bit about virtual pages ins Shopp Scott says that Shopp is complicated and the 4 hour webinar would help with learning it. Se talks about the method of teaching Shopp that they did in the webinar. Scott and his company likes Woocommerce and how simple it is to use. Se thinks that Woo, WooCommerce and WooThemes is a bit bloaty. http://www.woothemes.com/ Chris has gone years not receiving an emailed from Shopp, he received an email from them and he thinks they are ramping up on their marketing. Chris also like Easy Digital Downloads by Pippin. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ Chris also mentioned how Woo has made the theming cleaner and most of their options are unchecked to save you time in turning on just what you need. Chris mentions that caching that is agressive can mess with things, Scott mentions that he had recent experience with this and his host WP Engine stepped in and helped resolve these issues. http://www.wpengine.com Chris is a big fan of Woocommerce but if you are doing online downloads and such Easy Digital Downloads may be the way to go Jason asked about the simplicity or complexity of the backend for the site owner. Chris says Ecommerce is complicated and its a challenge to make it simple. Se talks about what she does at the Small Business Development Center and dealing with Paypal. Chris like how lightweight Cart66 is. https://cart66.com/ Wes brings up YAK and how light weight the plugin is. This uses posts and pages and is very easy for his customers to work with. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yak-for-wordpress/ Se says that Shopp is using CPT and also using an importer to import and export content. Se says ""it depends"" is the go to answer when it comes to E-Commerce and what solution to use. Wes brings up magento, we all gasp. Jason brings up using Gravity Forms as a way to create a small and simple shopping cart. http://www.gravityforms.com/ Dave says that doing a Gravity Forms cart would work well for small but the more complicated this will fall apart fast. http://www.gravityhelp.com/other-resources/ Dave rewrote the import tool to import 600 items into Shopp from excel. Chris talks about an importer for WooCommerce that deals with many forms and formats of data. Se talks about Winter time in the LBC Dave is interested in looking at WooCommerce Scott talks about Extensions on Woocommerce and how expensive it can be. Se mentions Behemoth when it comes to Woocommerce, Chris defends Woocommerce saying she's wrong about that. Se says she was talking about the back end of the site not the front end. Scott talks about how simple it is to add the template tags into your existing templates to work with WooCommerce. Se talks about how starting simple and working your way up instead of having to Jason mentions WP E-Commerce and everyone freaks out. Jason has used it in the past and didn't have any problems with it. Se talks about how hard it is to move out of some systems.  http://getshopped.org/ Wes says that WP E-Commerce is very inconsistent and just didn't work back when he used it a few years ago. Dave says that when he used it last there were many bugs and issues with the code. Se mentions doing updates and having issues. Dave would rather have a good user experience and use something that works well for him and his customers. Se wants the cart to work as well as WordPress itself does. Wes wants the ECommerce solution to just work, no late night phone calls and just trouble free. Chris mentions a new service called CloudSwipe that is a semi hosted solution and all the SSL certs and PCI compliance. http://cloudswipe.com/ Se mentions Foxycart http://www.foxycart.com/ We're now on Stitcher.com  http://stitcher.com/s?fid=31145&refid=stpr Chris Lema - http://ChrisLema.com Dave Jesch - http://davejesch.com Scott Bolinger - http://presscoders.com Se Reed - http://sereedmedia.com Wes Chyrchel - http://crowdedsite.com Jason Tucker - http://tucker.pro ---===--- Find us on: http://twitter.com/wpwatercooler http://www.facebook.com/wpwatercooler http://www.youtube.com/wpwatercooler Playlists: WordPress Designers http://goo.gl/CS6rq7 WordPress Development: goo.gl/b4b0HR WordPress eCommerce Solutions http://goo.gl/X7aIqE WordPress Plugins http://goo.gl/NEnM1m WordPress Themes http://goo.gl/iQUnqK WordCamps http://goo.gl/AHPXUE -~-~~-~~~-~~-~- Please watch: ""Beaver Tunnels - WPshowandtell"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdY-3tbCRbA -~-~~-~~~-~~-~-"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7N88TPHbY7U/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/7N88TPHbY7U"	"577f19ac51ac840a71d0118e"	"Create An Ecommerce WordPress Website In 3 Hours!

Ever heard the terms E-commerce or Electronic Commerce being thrown around? What are they exactly? No need to worry, I've got you covered. Everything you need to know about what E-Commerce is in one easy to understand video tutorial! Words like Ecommerce or Electronic commerce are often thrown around in all sorts of places but to properly understand them we must first go back to 1957. 1957 the birth of the internet and the framework for the digitization of our society although at this point the internet was very much restricted to military and government uses. So we'll have fast forward 32 years and here we are 1989 the year that affects us most the internet goes public, the birth of the internet. Increasingly, the internet has been seen to govern our lives and almost every aspect of life has been computerised from, doing research for a college paper, socializing with friends, gaming or just as a means of a time sink. It's no surprise that buying and selling have also taken to the internet which is exactly what ecommerce is.Today ecommerce or electronic commerce can be defined as any sort of transaction made on the internet. So If you've bought something whether physical or electronic on the internet then you've engaged in e commerce. This can include * Buying directly or buying through affiliates or agents If you've sold something online again whether physical or electronic you've also engaged in e commerce. This can include * Selling on your website * Selling through social networking sites * Selling through an auction site * And many more! E commerce can be between a business and customers also known as B2C B2C is what you've most likely been involved in. Ecommerce can between businesses and other businesses (e.g. one company buying hardware components from another) And it can also be between customers (P2P) e.g. people buying and selling on an auction website. Ecommerce provides a simple platform to do business with countries other than your own, long gone are the days where business was confined to your city, and where your audience is confined to your city. Ecommerce is huge and its growing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhgtoQIfuQ4 E commerce"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhgtoQIfuQ4/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/AhgtoQIfuQ4"	"577f19ac51ac840a71d0119a"	"2.

This is an overview of SellerCloud powerful catalog functionality that can help you sell on multiple channel and grow your business! Visit: http://www.sellercloud.com Our Wiki: http://wiki.sellercloud.com Back in the good old days you used to crank up your car before driving. You went to a drugstore to get soda-pop from a fountain. You tried not to forgot to empty the ice tray in the ice box. And back in the old days you also had to maintain separate product catalogs for each marketplace. For example, to sell on Amazon, you had to enter descriptions, add quantities, upload photos and set pricing in Seller Central. Selling on eBay required you repeat the whole process and maintain a separate catalog on your eBay account. Then you needed yet another catalog for your website! So while you wanted to expand to other marketplaces, the thought of managing even more catalogs seemed overwhelming. But now that you have SellerCloud, there's only one handle to crank! Because with SellerCloud, all of your sales channels are connected to your SellerCloud catalog. All you need is to maintain a single catalog in SellerCloud, and all of your products can be published to multiple sales channels. But there's a whole lot more when you use SellerCloud as your catalog manger! Let's say you want to create one listing that includes a camera together with several related products, like a memory card and a camera case. SellerCloud's powerful catalog functionality allows you to take individual items and list them together as a kit! And did you know that you can create variations in SellerCloud? Or Shadow SKUs? So while you may miss the old days of floppy discs and dial-up internet, you're moving forward with SellerCloud to manage listings everywhere from one centralized, powerful inventory catalog and grow your business!"

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f19ae51ac840a71d011b7"	"8.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Step-by-step (80/20) tutorial for starting your ecommerce business today. Build your business selling products and services online. Shopify is a great resource for those new to ecommerce and seasoned professionals. It's never been easier to tap into the (still growing) billion-dollar industry. Shopify makes the process of starting your own ecommerce website seamless. With a clean and simple interface, Shopify allows you to manage your website with the same amount of technical 'know-how' as is needed to manage an email account. Pretty simple right? In this short video I cover the essential steps in how to set up your very own ecommerce website. Shopify offers a free 14-day trial that removes any and all excuses. That's how I got started. I gave it a shot and kicked the tires. I'm glad I did. Shopify has helped my business immensely (and put dollars in my pocket). A few items covered in the video include how to set up your first product, select your store theme and make minor page and site updates to get your store ready for the marketplace. While the Shopify interface includes other features, they are not essential (think 80/20) to getting started selling today. I can't encourage you enough to get started in ecommerce even on a part-time basis. It can be a great way to enjoy a passion that will also put some money in your pocket. It's likely I'll create additional videos for some of the cool resources and integration opportunities with Shopify. This will cover topics like Promotions, Discounts and pulling Reports. As I touched on in the video, these items are not essential to get started. I get asked all the time about other ecommerce platforms such as BigCommerce and WooCommerce. While they continue to improve, I think Shopify offers the most solutions and options for the broad spectrum of business owners (from newbies to seasoned veterans). Being able to start right away (with a free theme) or be able to create a totally custom site is advantageous and hugely beneficial in the ecommerce marketplace. Having both the options and the simple and easy to use interface makes Shopify the best choice. I do hope you found this information helpful!

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Two boatloads of tourists were lucky enough to witness the feeding frenzy first-hand, watching on from above as the school of hungry sharks ruthlessly ate away at the enormous frame of the whale. The aerial vision was captured by Eco Abrolhos, an island tour company that stumbled upon the attack just four days into a 14-day cruise to the Kimberley, travelling from Geraldton to Broome."

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

You can check out the Advanced Coaching Course here: http://piotrkrzyzek.com/flatsome In this tutorial video we'll go over PART 1 of how to create a powerful and successful eCommerce website AND start selling within 1 hour (or so). In the next parts we'll go into greater customizations and functionality. Here, it's all about getting going so you can start selling fast. For this tutorial you'll need: * A domain name. * An account on a web host. * WordPress installed on that account. * A basic understanding of WordPress. To achieve our desired eCommerce website we'll need: * WooCommerce (free plugin) * Flatsome eCommerce WordPress Theme :: http://piotrkrzyzek.com/flatsometheme * A small bit of money to purchase themes and plugins You'll also want to create free accounts on: * ThemeForest :: http://piotrkrzyzek.com/themeforest * WooTheme :: http://woothemes.com In this video I go over: * Getting and installing Flatsome and the Flatsome Child theme * Install the required plugins * Setting up your brand design, colors, style, ect * Making an initial pretty home page * The (new) Flatsome Page Builder (still in beta so there are a few bugs which I talk about) * Setting up your first product * Setting up your Payment Gateways * Setting up shipping and taxes And within an hour (ignoring some rambling) ... well, technically 1 hour and 2 minutes, you'll be officially able to sell stuff online! Technically, you can start selling as soon as you installed WordPress, WooCommerce, setup Paypal Standard and your first product ... but that's for another video. This is video 1 where we setup the foundation and get you selling within 1 hour (or so). You can check out the Advanced Coaching course where I go over things like this in greater detail and coach/teach you personally through your website creation process: I hold you hand, answer all your questions personally and can even help you when you're stuck with customizations and code on your site.

Two boatloads of tourists were lucky enough to witness the feeding frenzy first-hand, watching on from above as the school of hungry sharks ruthlessly ate away at the enormous frame of the whale. The aerial vision was captured by Eco Abrolhos, an island tour company that stumbled upon the attack just four days into a 14-day cruise to the Kimberley, travelling from Geraldton to Broome."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

We're building Autopilot to give you more confidence behind the wheel, increase your safety on the road, and make highway driving more enjoyable. While truly driverless cars are still a few years away, Tesla Autopilot functions like the systems that airplane pilots use when conditions are clear. The driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car. What's more, you always have intuitive access to the information your car is using to inform its actions."

Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f19b351ac840a71d0122b"	"The 5 Major Don'ts of Building an Ecommerce Site | Two Minute Tuesdays"	"youtube.com"	"If you manage an online store, you're probably well-versed in the ""do's"" of ecommerce business management.

How to dropship? For online retail, finding trusted merchandise suppliers is important. Good source of merchandise supplies give you profitable goods and customer support as well as variety. With dropshipping, your customer's order is drop shipped directly from the wholesaler. You don't need to stock any inventory. Online retail can be done through market places such as eBay, amazon. You can also build retail websites yourself using some free shopping cart such as zencart, or you can build free webstores such as vendio, ecrater. Dropship is a good way for volume selling. With multiple trusted dropship suppliers, all you need to do to maintain your storefront is download/upload inventory datafeed. In this video, I demonstrate a retail shopping site of mine (built with zencart) and some sales record, a vendio webstore and its sales record. I also show a sample datafeed spreadsheet. The advantage of selling on ebay and amazon is that they do the advertising for you, but you still have to compete for ranking against fellow sellers. The advantage of selling from your own website or webstores is that you don't have to pay any fees. In that case, you compete in the larger google market place (google merchant center, formerly google base). With online retail, you can literally set it up and start making money in a matter of hours. Do not procrastinate. Start making money now!
