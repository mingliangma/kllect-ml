In my opinion, for developers, this is the easiest way to add e-commerce to your website either with Javascript or PHP. With a few lines of code, you have products on your page, and you can checkout. Another GREAT feature about Moltin, is you can easily separate your codebase from the Admin tool that non-developers use to manage your storefront, inventory, shipping, orders, etc."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Icltr-6nRLg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/Icltr-6nRLg"	"577f19b451ac840a71d0124a"	"Shopify Store Pro Review - Amazing Shopify Ecommerce Training by Jacque In Atlanta"	"youtube.com"	"http://dropshipmogul.com/shopify   Learn More Today! http://dropshipmogul.com  Sell on Ebay, Bonanza & Amazon ASAP Shopify Store Pro is the most comprehensive e-commerce program that I've seen in years.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video :

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758fa0751ac8421ccf5513b"	"5 Gadgets you did not know EXISTED! >41"	"youtube.com"	"New amazing inventions, cool gadgets, futuristic new technology, and things you didn't know existed.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758fa0851ac8421ccf55153"	"5 Gadgets you did not know EXISTED! >43"	"youtube.com"	"New amazing inventions, cool gadgets, futuristic new technology, and things you didn't know existed.

Yes you read that correctly - the age of the Jetsons has arrived with this 500lb electric single seat passenger drone. The Ehang 184 is a giant but elegantly designed drone; according to the company, it can transport one person at approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in around 23-minutes. It can also carry a payload (that's the passenger and anything else they take with them) of about 100 kg (220 lbs). You plan your trip via an app on your smart phone and the drone takes off and delivers you to your destination autonomously whilst you read the latest articles from http://www.gogeteco.com or search online for the best life insurance deals you can find. The makers claim that is has a fail safe mode so that anything goes wrong it goes into a hover or finds somewhere safe to land. The design has built in redundancy with duplicate sensors, eight motors, eight propellors and sensors that prevent it taking off in a storm. Whilst it is not legal in the US yet (or any other jurisdictions that we know of) it has completed over 100 test flights with an actually live person on board. Reported to cost in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 its not a cheap way to avoid the traffic but it certainly is a mix between brilliant and crazy - some would even say a potential disruptor! Are you ready to climb aboard and fly in this drone?

"5758daa951ac842068292c71"	"HMS Hi-tech, the warship of the future"	"youtube.com"	"Sleek and stealthy, it resembles something from Star Wars. In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size.

"5758daa951ac842068292c71"	"HMS Hi-tech, the warship of the future"	"youtube.com"	"Sleek and stealthy, it resembles something from Star Wars. In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics.

Struggled carrying a big camera while traveling? Wanted to share your experiences with your loved ones instantly? Captured tons of photos and videos, but only to keep them on your memory card forever? From now on, you can forget about GoPro, DropCam, baby monitors, dash cams and selfie cams...because YoCam does it all. YoCam was designed and engineered to be the world's smallest waterproof life camera--and the lightest one, too. Unlike the cameras that can only meet one or two of your needs, we have designed YoCam as an all-in-one smart camera that will accommodate all your daily needs. In order to achieve this goal, YoCam must be powerful, versatile and affordable. Here are the features we are going to incorporate into YoCam: Without sacrificing any functionalities, YoCam weighs only 2oz (~55g). Our product is the ultimate portable camera! YoCam is lighter, smaller and much more powerful than GoPro's smallest camera, HERO4 Session: YoCam has an IP68 rating, and it is housing-free waterproof up to 20 feet. From now on, no additional housing or case is needed for shooting underwater! At only 2oz (~55g) in your palm, YoCam is built as the most water-friendly camera on the market. YoCam features a number of advanced technologies, such as our MoSteady(tm) stabilization technology, HDR and a P2P remote internet connection--none of which have ever appeared in a camera of this size. https://goo.gl/02SIjV"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SLIYPIjSvzg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/SLIYPIjSvzg"	"5758fa0c51ac8421ccf551b1"	"Top 5 Tech Gadgets & Accessories Under $50!"

Unfortunately, you've probably spent untold minutes? hours? days? of your life swiping up on apps in a fruitless effort to do so. The man in charge of iOS at Apple, Craig Federighi, has confirmed that there is no need to bother killing your apps because it won't help your battery life. Mashable reports that Federighi's confirmation came in an email to an Apple customer, who had originally written to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In an email that was later published on 9to5Mac, the customer wrote to Cook and asked, ""do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary for battery life?""

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758fa0e51ac8421ccf551d9"	"Lenovo Vibe X3 | Features & Release Date | Dual SIM"	"youtube.com"	"Lenovo Vibe X3 | Features & Release Date | Dual SIM This is Our New YouTube channel.Subscribe our channel for hands on video of new mobile phones, tablets and other new technology gadgets.we will upload new gadgets videos,Informational Videos, Unique Gadgets & Tech, Android Apps & Games, Leaks, Rumors, Comparison, iOS Apps & Games,Tutorials, How-Tos, Custom ROMs , and Many More..

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758fa0f51ac8421ccf551e7"	"Easiest Method to Install Screen protection Films on Smartphones, Gadgets, Tablets and LCD"	"youtube.com"	"How to install the protection film on LCD Screens 1. align the protector 2. make a hing 3. check alignment 4. if ok, peel of safety film 5.

As any true Star Trek fan will tell you, there's a very good reason that every alien species in the galaxy speaks English - each Starfleet officer's chest-worn communicator badge is also a universal translator. That's kind of what ""iLi,"" from Japanese startup Logbar, is going for. The ability to have an intelligible conversation with someone who speaks a different language has long been a holy grail for tech's biggest companies. Titans like Microsoft and Google have made this kind of real-time translation a major priority with apps like Skype Translate and Google Translate. Users hold down a button and speak into this device, which automatically translates their words into English, Chinese or Japanese. Future languages that expected to be added include French, Thai, Korean, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. A refrigerator that can order groceries,. Decades ago, the thought of having a computer in your refrigerator seemed unnecessary. But Samsung's state-of-the-art fridge shows how much technology can help us with our food. The web-enabled appliance can send pictures of what your food looks like to your smartphone when you're away ,and even can allow users to order groceries from the device and even watch TV from another shared Samsung device. An alarm clock that wakes people up with smells instead of sounds ,. Waking up to the same obnoxious alarm noise can become tiresome very quickly. This alarm from Sensorwake though attempts to make the act of waking up much more soothing to your senses, using fragrances like hot croissant, peppermint, chocolate and more to get you out of bed. toy that teaches children the basics of coding ,. Aimed at kids 3-8 years old, this Fisher Price toy comes with eight modules with their own different functions, intended to give toddlers a small introduction into coding. robot that can project movie-sized screens anywhere around the house ,. Move over R2-D2, there's another picture-projecting droid in town. The Tipron robot can project up to an 80-inch-screen and can adjust the size of the screen while moving. A sleek car that makes drivers feel weightless,. This fully-electric, single seat car boasts speeds up to 200-mph, 1000 -horsepower while looking very easy on the eyes. Two of the coolest features of Faraday Future's electric car is the smartphone integration and the zero gravity driving station, allowing drivers to feel ""an unparalleled sense of weightlessness and reduced driver fatigue."" Virtual reality devices that can transport you to a new digital world ,. The Oculus Rift is now on sale to the public and HTC and Samsung's devices are also expected to have a real impact on consumers in 2016, with many companies planning innovative ways to incorporate the technology. here are the list of upcoming futuristic gadgets of 2016 ILI - Language translator BUY AT-https://www.producthunt.com/tech/ili SAMSUNG FAMILY HUB BUY AT-http://www.samsung.com/global/ces2016/familyhub/ ALARM CLOCK BUY AT-https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/222459303/sensorwake-wake-up-happy-with-the-smell-based-alar FISHER PRICE CODING TOY BUY AT-http://www.fisher-price.com/shop/ OCCULU RIFT BUY AT-https://www1.oculus.com/order/ HTC VIVE BUY AT-http://www.htcvive.com/us/ SUBSCRIBE AND  FOLLOW FOR MORE TECH NEWS FOLLOW ME AT-https://twitter.com/GoneIn180 FACEBOOK-https://www.facebook.com/gonein180"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XeOCz6C-UMk/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/XeOCz6C-UMk"

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1a6951ac840a951edd4f"	"A Very Strange Smartphone..."

The man in charge of iOS at Apple, Craig Federighi, has confirmed that there is no need to bother killing your apps because it won't help your battery life. Mashable reports that Federighi's confirmation came in an email to an Apple customer, who had originally written to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In an email that was later published on 9to5Mac, the customer wrote to Cook and asked, ""do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary for battery life?""

Camino, along with her husband and siblings (also architects at their firm Abaton), created APH80, a tiny home that ships like furniture, but has the style and usability of a smartphone. Their Casa Transportable (""Transportable House"") is manufactured in 6 weeks in a CNC factory in Northern Spain. Their largest model (9 by 3 meters) is still small enough to fit on the back of a truck. The height of 3.5 meters allows for a gabled roof to give it the feel of a real house, but it's just low enough to fit under bridges and tunnels while on the road. Once the house arrives at the site, like a shipping container, it is craned into place in as little as 20 minutes. When Abaton installed their prototype house on an empty plot in a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of Madrid, they had dug a few small holes in preparation for the  ""foundation footings"": in this case, recycled wood blocks leftover from other construction projects, but cement or a nice rock work as foundation as well. Abaton provides instructions and sketches so any crane operator can put the home in place. The home arrive fully plumbed and wired. Their prototype home is the ""apartment"" with kitchen/living room, bathroom (with full shower) and bedroom (bed included), but they offer other models for those looking interested in simply placing an extra bedroom in their backyard (they offer several combinations e.g. a bedroom/bathroom, 2 bedrooms, living room/kitchen, bedroom/living room). CNC-milled grey cement-board panels lock together to provide not only a sleek exterior, but a ventilated facade. This layered exterior along with 10 centimeters of insulation means the home is thermally efficient - useful for off-grid purposes, but it also means that even without AC on a very hot day in Madrid, the inside of the space stayed cool. Abaton: http://abaton.es Furniture by http://batavia.es A video with the Alonso's at the abandoned stable they turned into a country home: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gcgz6aZ3jk. Price range:  Beginning from a 2 room bedroom/bath combo that is 4.5 x 3 meters for 21.900EUR. It goes up from there with a 2 bedroom combo, living room/kitchen, bedroom/living, 2 bedrooms/1 bath. And finally, the tiny house shown in the video, the APH80-A Apartment is 27 m2 (290 sq ft) and costs 42.800EUR.

There is no software running on the prototype as the primary purpose of this prototype is to begin hardware integration and to get OEMs excited about the potential of Polytrons technology. This is an interesting begining for something that most consider a piece of tech that we would only see in Sci-Fi flicks. Taking a closer look at the smartphone we've got a bunch of components that won't be transparent, the SD card and the SIM card which will be placed directly above it. They've only got 2 watch batteries in there for the moment to power the LED to show that the material they've made the phone out of will indeed conduct power.  At the top we've got a micro camera and a microphone.

We're building Autopilot to give you more confidence behind the wheel, increase your safety on the road, and make highway driving more enjoyable. While truly driverless cars are still a few years away, Tesla Autopilot functions like the systems that airplane pilots use when conditions are clear. The driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car. What's more, you always have intuitive access to the information your car is using to inform its actions."

It means that you can get an image about 60 inch! For this DIY Smartphone Projector (that will REALLY WORK!) you will need: 2 shoe boxes (2! not 1!), magnifying glass (I used cheap magnifying glass which diameter was 75 mm), electrical or black duct tape, scissors and knife, black paint, a pencil and a ruler, smartphone (or even PAPER PHOTOS!). First step is to connect 2 shoe boxes. Mine were 33 cm each. So I've got 66 cm projector. You can take 1 large box (60 cm), but it should be narrow. How to connect boxes - watch in my video tutorial. Next step - is to cut off a hole for magnifying glass. Next - to cover all holes in boxes to make the light pass through the magnifying glass ONLY! Then paint inside of your boxes black! I used watercolor, but you can use gouache, spray paint, just glue inside part of boxes with matte black paper - whatever! You'll need a smartphone holder, so I made one out of a plastic bottle bottom (watch in my video tutorial). Set the holder to the inside back part of the first box (that one which is without magnifying glass). Put your phone to the holder (screen should be turned to the magnifying glass). Important! Phone settings! Turn phone screen brightness to the maximum. Turn off screen rotation. Flip your phone upside down (so ppl in video or photo will be turned - their feet will be up, and their heads will be down). About focus and distance: tune the focus with moving your smartphone (with holder) backwards and forwards in the first box. Here are few tips about distance: 1. Distance from phone to magnifying glass - 60 cm,  Distance from magnifying glass to the wall - 1 m, image size - ~8 inch 2. Distance from phone to magnifying glass - 50 cm,  Distance from magnifying glass to the wall - 1.5 m, image size - ~15 inch 3.  Distance from phone to magnifying glass - 40 cm,  Distance from magnifying glass to the wall - 5 m, image size - ~60 inch So, turn off light in your room and start the movie! :) You can also project paper photos! Use a flashlight for this. Watch in my video tutorial how to set it right. Good luck!"

The tumour can develop in young children from birth and often reflects back as a white pupil. Early detection is the key to saving their sight and their lives. So we developed CHECT Flash Photo Posters to show parents that they can detect eye cancer in their child simply by taking a photo.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1a6b51ac840a951edd71"	"XRobots - Iron Man Hulkbuster Cosplay Part 36, Smartphone Control!"

Powerup Toys has been making kits that add a battery powered propeller to paper airplanes. In this new 3.0 version, they have added the ability to control the plane with a smartphone! Just about any regular paper will work - I followed some instructional videos on Powerup's YouTube page and built myself the 'invader' from standard copy paper. The engine clips on to the paper airplane and very quickly paired with my phone. Powerup includes a 1200 mah lithium ion battery pack that can charge the plane's motor in the field.  It'll also plug directly into a computer for charging. Controlling the plane takes some practice but I was able to keep my plane aloft for a significant amount of time. The Bluetooth range is limited but this isn't something you're going to fly for long distances. I do recommend flying in fairly large open spaces with minimal wind. What I like most about this is the experimentation that can come from the very open nature of the product. Tweaking different paper airplane designs will result in different flight behaviors. The fast charge time makes it possible to do a lot of trial and error to find the perfect design. Great for kids to learn about the physics of flight.

Mashable reports that Federighi's confirmation came in an email to an Apple customer, who had originally written to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Easy fix. Most questions from the comments are answered below, feel free to comment with any comments or other questions :) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF THE VIDEO DID NOT CLARIFY THE ACTUAL FIX; Tap the power button repeatedly with a little force (use a fingernail against the button, as you would tap your nail on a desk) that usually frees it from its stuck position. IS THIS THE FIX FOR YOUR PHONE? If you took your battery out and your phone boots on its own when you put the battery back in (keeps resetting) without touching any buttons then the power button is indeed your issue. If not, it's something else. IF YOUR PHONE BOOTS RIGHT WHEN YOU PUT THE BATTERY IN (DESCRIBED ABOVE) AND MY SOLUTION DIDN'T WORK; Unfortunately your button needs a darn good cleaning (taking your phone apart and cleaning the button with compressed air, denatured alcohol etc.) or needs replacement. This video and description are to be done at your own risk. I am not responsible for any possible damages and am only here to help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/25/16 TRY ENABLING ""POWER SAVING MODE"" this is a useful tip posted by a viewer.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

"5758daa951ac842068292c71"	"HMS Hi-tech, the warship of the future"	"youtube.com"	"Sleek and stealthy, it resembles something from Star Wars. In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1a6d51ac840a951edda5"	"Elder Scrolls sur SmartPhone ? - Hard Corner (Benzaie)"	"youtube.com"	"Ma page facebook: http://facebook.com/benzaieTV ma 2nde Chaine 100% Gameplay http://youtube.com/benzaielive"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rYgHjAmQOKw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/rYgHjAmQOKw"	"577f1a6d51ac840a951edda6"	"Smartphone Addicts - Are you one of them?"

KINGSTON - Researchers at the Human Media Lab at Queen's University have developed the world's first holographic flexible smartphone. The device, dubbed HoloFlex, is capable of rendering 3D images with motion parallax and stereoscopy to multiple simultaneous users without head tracking or glasses. ""HoloFlex offers a completely new way of interacting with your smartphone. It allows for glasses-free interactions with 3D video and images in a way that does not encumber the user."" says Dr. Vertegaal. HoloFlex features a 1920x1080 full high-definition Flexible Organic Light Emitting Diode (FOLED) touchscreen display. Images are rendered into 12-pixel wide circular blocks rendering the full view of the 3D object from a particular viewpoint. These pixel blocks project through a 3D printed flexible microlens array consisting of over 16,000 fisheye lenses. The resulting 160 x 104 resolution image allows users to inspect a 3D object from any angle simply by rotating the phone.

The Veer, HP's first original smartphone powered by the platform the company acquired when it bought Palm, Inc. Like the flagship Pre, this handset features a sliding hardware QWERTY keyboard. But according to the press release, it's ""the smallest webOS phone to date -- the size of a credit card and no thicker than a deck of cards."" So while the trend may be mammoth displays (ahem! Infuse), this one goes the opposite way and crams a full-fledged smartphone into a tiny package, with ""4G"" no less. (It actually supports HSDPA Cat 10, HSUPA Cat 6.) Available on May 15 for $99 (with two-year contract), the Veer offers features that include the following: 800-MHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7230 processor 2.57-inch multitouch glass screen with 18-bit color (320 x 400 res) Gesture area Full slide-out hardware QWERTY keyboard Support for Adobe Flash Player 10.1 beta Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, integrated GPS, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR with A2DP stereo Bluetooth support, hotspot functionality 5MP camera Rechargeable 910 mAh non removable battery (for up to 5 hrs talk time) 8GB built-in storage Compatible with Touchstone charger (available separately) Tri-band UMTS, quad-band GSM/EDGE world phone Measures 54.5 x 84 x 15.1 mm (2.1 x 3.3 x 0.6 inches) Weighs 103 grams (3.6 ounces) Available in white or black So what do you think? Is there a market for this? Are you a WebOS fan choosing between the Veer this month or waiting until the summer for the Pre3? Or an AT&T user looking at 4G options?

If you missed that video, maybe you caught our article from last week discussing sapphire's importance to the future of the mobile industry. If you missed both of those, then you're still in luck - because this piece right here trumps them both. You see, it turns out that the GT Crystal Systems facility at which much of the aforementioned sapphire is manufactured sits just up the road from Pocketnow's Boston offices in Salem, MA. So Jeff, being the nice guy that he is, invited us for a visit to get a feel for just how sapphire smartphone displays are made. And since we like science and smartphones, and really like it when those two fields intersect in a way we can photograph, we packed our camera and went for a ride ...

Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1bcf51ac840ab7389159"	"Facebook, Twitter Revolutionizing How Parents Stalk Their College-Aged Kids"	"youtube.com"	"Subscribe to The Onion on YouTube: http://bit.ly/xzrBUA 'E-Mom' Gloria Bianco shows Jim and Tracy how geographical distance is no longer a roadblock to shamelessly interfering with the lives of your children.

Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1bcf51ac840ab738915b"	"BREAKING NEWS: Fmr.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1bcf51ac840ab738915d"	"24Oras: Yaya Dub at Alden Richards, may light moments sa backstage"	"youtube.com"	"GMA News Online: http://www.gmanews.tv Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/gmanews Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/gmanews"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UmDa4y0BF3w/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/UmDa4y0BF3w"	"577f1bcf51ac840ab738915e"	"Phuthai news Ep19"	"youtube.com"	"UNA STUDIO yuunaasahuudio` Facebook : Ther Una Fanpage : https://www.facebook.com/UnaLaos Tel : +8562097966777"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZCUSnepccc/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/uZCUSnepccc"

Kira Hudson's 12-year-old daughter wanted to set up accounts on Facebook and Instagram. Her mother did not approve and explained that images posted online can spread farther than anyone has control over. To prove her point, she posted a photo of her daughter holding up a sign which encouraged users to share the image as widely as possible. Hudson was absolutely right; the image was shared thousands of times, and liked more than a million times by the end of the experiment. What Hudson did not anticipate was the backlash by online users who felt the project amounted public shaming. The photograph made its way to the 4chan photo board where fast-acting users modified the image in profane ways, then cracked Hudson's own online profiles to get her home address and phone number. Pranksters on 4chan crank called the number, and had pizzas delivered to the Hudson home. Hudson subsequently removed the image from Facebook and later wrote a letter to the Huffington Post, telling netizens that she had learned a lesson about online security. She also added that the contact information they had uncovered was for her former home, and apologized to the current occupants of the house for any distress caused by the stunt."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Sean Parker, president of Facebook at the time, asked Choe to paint his famous murals on the office walls for $60,000 or company stock. PHOTO: Artist David Choe, who painted murals at the headquarters of Facebook Inc. in exchange for an undisclosed amount of company stock, works in his studio in the Chinatown section of New York, May 28, 2009.

View Full Size Mortgage Settlement: Banks Pay Up Watch Video Fed Announces $25 Billion Foreclosure Deal Watch Video U.S. Jobless Claims Near 4-Year Low Watch Video Choe chose the stock, and when Facebook, started by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room, announced its IPO this month, or initial public offerings of stock, to raise $5 billion, Choe made an estimated $200 million. The murals are still in the Facebook offices today. ""They carved the walls out and they shipped them to every single Facebook office in the world -- so they're everywhere now,"" Choe said. The work was not initially well-received by Parker, who called it ""schizophrenicly distracting."" In Choe's Dirty Hands Movie, Parker asked him flatly, ""There's nothing more for you to add to it?"" The murals were varied, with different kinds of objects, Choe told Walters. ""There was lots of women, cityscapes, just abstract forms,"" he said. ""I paint very quickly. And it just, it almost comes out of me like it's almost my therapy."" In 2003, before being commissioned by Facebook, Choe led a difficult life, doing jail time for cashing forged checks, stealing, and hitting a security guard. However, he still managed to paint with whatever he could find. ""I would use the soy sauce,"" he said. ""And I don't want to be gross, but I would use urine and blood and all these things, and anything that would create any kind of pigment. ... It was the only thing that let me keep my sanity."" Although Choe sold some of the stock a while ago, he said, ""I just sold a couple ... to just secure that I would have something out of this in case anything changed."" Choe still has an estimated couple hundred million dollars after the exchange. ""Don't feel sorry for me,"" he told Walters. ""This is like a godlike amount of money, where I could actually change the world and do things to help humanity and do good things. ""As an artist, I often wonder what my purpose is or why I do what I do,"" he said. ""So those things will hopefully come into more clarity, or maybe not. I don't know.""

That did not stop the bullies. One month after her suicide, the offline and online bullying that tormented Rebecca for over a year was still a sickening miasma thriving in venues such as Facebook. And now, two girls - ages 12 and 14 - have been arrested and charged in connection with the bullying, after the 14-year-old allegedly bragged on Facebook about her part in Rebecca's death, signing the post with a little red heart. The bullying was reportedly started over a boyfriend. According to the New York Times, the sheriff's office of Polk County, in the US state of Florida, which has been investigating the suicide, was alerted to the Facebook post over the weekend. The poster said that she knows, and does not care, that her bullying led to Sedwick's suicide. Polk County deputies had been investigating around 12 girls for allegedly harassing Rebecca by calling her ugly and worthless, telling her that she deserved to die, and urging her to drink bleach, the Orlando Sentinel reports. On Monday, police arrested the alleged author of the post along with another 12-year-old girl. In a news conference on Tuesday, Polk Sheriff Grady Judd said that the poster of the hateful comment did not get the enormity of this tragedy. The girls, neither of whom had a prior arrested record, were charged with the third-degree felony charge of aggravated stalking. The older girl was taken into custody in the juvenile wing of the county jail. Police said the younger girl expressed remorse and therefore was released to her parents under house arrest. I can appreciate Sheriff Judge's anger, amazement and frustration as he and his deputies, and, of course, Rebecca's family, have been faced with this horrible situation, which has continued to spread ripples even beyond her death. Smashing devices in front of children may sound like a decisive and satisfying way to stop the hateful environment that can engulf a cyber bullying victim. But it won't stop the harassment, whether you smash the victim's smartphone or you take a hammer to the bully's laptop. In fact, Rebecca's mother told news outlets that she didn't take away her daughter's smartphone because of the fear of alienating her in this way. As for the bullies, they'll find a way, device or no device, virtually or in the real world. As Rebecca's story points out, the abuse spills out in both arenas. There are many other resources out there to help fight cyber bullying, short of pulverizing kids' phones."

Woman Post on Facebook Moment Before Fatal Crash. Woman dies in head-on collision seconds after posting selfie of herself on Facebook. Courtney Sanford died while posting to Facebook about one of her favorite songs. A 32-year-old North Carolina woman is dead after slamming her car head-on into a truck while posting selfies and a Facebook update about how happy she was while listening to a Pharrell song. Courtney Sanford, of High Point, crossed the center median of a busy road Thursday morning just after making the post, hit a recycling truck and died, police said. Further inspection of her phone revealed pictures posted online only minutes earlier. The last words Sanford shared with her friends? 'The happy song makes me HAPPY.' Authorities said the post, visible only to her friends, was made at 8.33 a.m., the first 911 call received about the crash was one minute later. 'In a matter of seconds, a life was over just so she could notify some friends that she was happy,' a police spokesperson told WGHB. Footage from the scene showed Sanford's car had careened off the road into a ditch near some trees. The recycling truck was only feet away, also in the grass. Sanford's car caught on fire after running off the road. The truck hit a tree. Woman killed in car crash seconds after posting about her love of 'Happy' to Facebook; selfies while driving.

I also thought the Draw Mohammed Day message was very susceptible to being spun in a way that missed the real free speech message. Regarding that last point, I saw a Fox News story this week using just the kind of spin I was worried about when the show ""America's News HQ"" reported on Pakistan lifting a ban on Facebook that resulted from Draw Mohammed Day as I show in this video. The clips I use of Fox News come from the a segment of the program ""America's News HQ"" broadcast May 31, 2010 (which I have not been able to find online). the image I use of Thunderf00t's channel comes from his YouTube page at http://www.youtube.com/thunderf00t#g/u The image of the 2005 cartoons of Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten comes from the webpage at http://zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/jyllands-posten_cartoons/"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ip7W0vHICys/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/ip7W0vHICys"

In practice, it's pretty much just a collection of your uncle's conspiracy theories about how the government is run by lizard people. Facebook finally wants to change that. Starting today, users will be able to help Facebook spot hoaxes and hopefully stop the spread of bad information. Using the Report Post feature, users will now have the option to mark a story as false news. When a number of people have reported the story as inaccurate and full of dirty lies, Facebook will add an annotation to warn users that many others have reported it as fake. Rather than rely simply on user-reported accounts, which will no doubt consist of people trying to tag news stories as inaccurate when in actuality they just don't agree with it, Facebook will also contribute to the cause by tracking how often stories are deleted.""

And we're listening. She posted a lengthy statement on Facebook to thank everyone for their support and to boot, Lady Gaga also expressed her support with a sentimental photo. Kesha's situation is a complete nightmare and she let her voice be heard through facebook to update her supporters. Kesha's battle for her right to make music continues and she recently spoke out for the first time with a Facebook post to show her gratitude for those who have rallied behind her. In her statement, Kesha said QUOTE - ""All I ever wanted was to be able to make music without being afraid, scared, or abused. This case has never been about a renegotiation of my record contract - it was never about getting a bigger, or a better deal. This is about being free from my abuser. I would be willing to work with Sony if they do the right thing and break all ties that bind me to my abuser. I don't want my future daughter-or your daughter--or any person to be afraid that they will be punished if they speak out about being abused, especially if their abuser is in a position of power. Unfortunately I don't think that my case is giving people who have been abused confidence that they can speak out, and that's a problem."" She went on to say QUOTE - ""if you have been abused, please don't be afraid to speak out. There are places that will make you feel safe. There are people who will help you. I for one, will stand beside you and behind you. I know now how this all feels and will forever fight for you the way perfect strangers have been fighting for me. Yes, I am very much a feminist, but more than that, I am a humanist. I believe in supporting my fellow human beings in being SAFE. I can't believe that so many people all over the world took the time to show me support and love. Other entertainers who knowingly put their own careers at stake by supporting me, I will be forever grateful."" Kesha's peers in the industry have been pouring out their support non-stop including Lady Gaga who recently posted a sweet photo with Kesha, hand in hand with the caption - ""Free Kesha"" along with an adorable snapchat showing Kesha love with a smooch on the cheek.  She also tweeted her support saying QUOTE - ""There are people all over the world who love you @KeshaRose. And I can say truly I am in awe of your bravery."" On the opposite end of the spectrum, Dr. Luke, the man who Kesha is fighting against in court, also released a statement via Twitter recently in an effort to clear his name saying QUOTE - ""...It's a shame that there's so much speculation out there basing itself on so little information...The only trulyobjective person who knows the facts is the judge. The judge did not rule in Kesha's favor on Friday...I didn't rape Kesha and I have never had sex with her."" It's all just a really unfortunate situation and we're keeping our fingers crossed for Kesha that justice will prevail. We love you girl. So what do you guys think about Kesha's statement?

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Since this latest example of getting profoundly busted via Snapchat doesn't involve the same people (characters?) and is thus not a sequel, let's just call this one a reboot. A suspicious boyfriend actually took the time to pose as another man on Snapchat in an effort to ""trap"" his purportedly cheating girlfriend, reports the Daily Mail. The man, who remains unidentified, apparently decided to get his revenge by sharing some of the intimate snaps he received from the equally unidentified woman on Facebook. However, as noted by the Mail's reporters, many are questioning the authenticity of not only the photos, but the story itself. This boyfriend / detective apparently set up the fake Snapchat account using pics of his friend and presumed cheater accomplice, also understandably described quite eloquently as ""unidentified."" For additional Snapchat-related melodrama, do peep this underrated Cocky Snapcheater spin-off.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1c1d51ac840ac74ea29b"	"Teen Killed His Classmate Then Posed With The Dead Body For Snapchat Selfie Ft.

A woman identified only as ""Chelsea"" was reportedly on a business trip (probably a lie) when she snapped her husband sexy photos of herself in her hotel room. Her scheme was foiled when one of her photo's pictured something her husband did not want to see--men's boots. Chelsea's husband was quick to notice the boots and immediately accused of her of being with someone else in the room, which she denied. Tired of being made a fool, Chelsea's husband pointed out the cheating evidence saying, ""I can't go through this again. I'm calling a lawyer."" Being cheated on once is bad enough, but two times? The only thing that would've made this more messed up is if the side dude was the one taking and sending the photos, which seems to have been the case because how could she sign off on those snaps before looking them over, even for quality sake or something. Reckless.

Aka she posed seductively and didn't do much else other than posing. Oh wait, she did KIND of try to rap. Well, lip sync rap. But mainly her point was to share her sexiness And to further that point, Kylie wore this sheer jersey featuring a dirty take on the classic In-N-Out Burger logo, but reading ""Eat Me Out"" with an arrow pointing south instead. And the crowd went wild! Twitter users quickly reacted with disbelief that this 17 year old would wear such a suggestive shirt. @KCMontero tweeted ""money can't buy class."" Another person said, ""If I walked out the house wearing that my mom would drag me back in & kill me."" Me, too, Kayla. Me, too. But the shirt gained a few fans, too. A woman named Hannah tweeted: ""Be as mad as you want about Kylie Jenner's ""Eat me out"" shirt, but I've been trying to buy it online for like an hour."" Keep in mind, when your sister has made your family famous from a leaked sex porno video of you with a rapper, then wearing an ""Eat Me Out"" shirt probably seems like child's play. And the other counter argument is... sure, Kylie's 17. But isn't age just a number? Maybe her maturity exceeds her biological age. Or maybe... it doesn't. And all these super sexed up snap chat videos are further proof that at 17 we're all a little insecure and will do anything to feel pretty.

Okay, I don't like feeling a creeper but it's come to my attention that JB and SG were in the same vicinity last night - and a whole lot of people want an explanation. Well, apparently they were both at a church group in LA - and the proof is in the snapchat. Both stars helped pimp out the snapchat account for Hillsong pastor, Rich Wilkerson Jr. (I think he might be the son of a preacher man, if we're getting technical here!) Take a look. If you missed it, that's Selena at the end of the video... and if you're not sure, there was another snap vid sent out from the pastor's account, CLEARLY showing the pop star talking to camera. And according to reports, Jelena were also present at church on Sunday night... so perhaps this is a friendly rekindling or something more. Basically, I want to hear from you - are you saying PTL (praise the lord) about this news or are you just wanting these two young loves to move on from each other? Personally, I just want them to be happy and I don't care if they date or not - but I gotta get the facts out there for the fans!

AND amidst her little jam sesh, she posted one video of an unrecognizable song with the caption ""New new new music."" Looking flawless per usual, Sel lip sang the lyrics that say ""Do you stay up late just so you don't dream?"" Right after the short clip Selena went right back to singing Fifth Harmony like nothing ever happened... WUT? I mean I like to work from home too, but we need to hear some more of this upcoming track... Some are speculating the song is all about Justin Bieber, in light of everything that has been going down between the two as of late... I mean, if Sel would have dropped this teaser even a month ago we would have never even thought about Justin... But I mean come on... With the TB kissing photos, the concert attending, and then with Justin supposedly blowing her off at the I Heart Radio Mucis Awards... UGH too much is happening, which does make for the perfect material to write some new music, PLUS the singers both know writing songs about each other makes all the JELENA fans go NUTS AF. Maybe Selena thinks Justin doesn't want to dream, because he'll dream about her... ORRR maybe we're all just being really crazy and Justin has nothing to do with the song... I don't know... I like to explore all options... YA DIG? Either way, Girl looks soooo good, (you know, just screams *highest followed person on Instagram*) and if Justin isn't about it, I'm sure she'll find a new man... ANYWAYS, sorry for making Sels new song all about Justin and not her... but let me know what you think?? Are you LIVING for some new music from Selena Gomez???

Watch PRICELESS Reaction"	"youtube.com"	"This episode brought to you by T-Mobile, the network that doubled its LTE coverage in the last year. Join the millions who've switched to T-Mobile. http://bit.ly/1SIk59G Super Bowl Halftime highlights >> https://youtu.be/ymG24Ep9j2o More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Jay-Z may be leading the rap game, but his social media kills need a little work Today's episode of Clevver Newsfeed is brought to you by T-Mobile, the un-carrier So Jay-Z may need a crash course in social media apps. I mean, if you need a tutor, Jay, I got you. Jay-Z was, of course, in attendance at this year's Superbowl, cheering on Beyonce who we all know by now, delivered a hugely entertaining halftime show alongside the show's main event, Coldplay, and fellow guest star, Bruno Mars. And while we could talk about their performance for like, ever, we got a real good kick out of Beyonce's man when he stopped to pose for what he thought was a picture with Bey & Usher during the game. In a hilarious snapchat vid that has since gone viral, Usher notices Jay-Z may not understand that he is the subject of a snapchat vid. He turns around to tell Jay-Z he's taking a video for snapchat, to which Jay-Z replies with QUOTE ""I don't even know what that means."" Take a look. Aw, I can't help but think that his reaction is simply adorable, and in fact, it appears that even Beyonce didn't quite get what Usher was trying to do. But I mean, the two are so busy being nothing less than Hollywood royalty, can we really blame them if they're not down with the latest social media trends? Even more adorable than their backstage snaps, was what went down before the game. While Beyonce rehearsed for her performance, photos show Jay-Z and their daughter Blue Ivy cheering Bey on, in support, from the sidelines. These three are they closest we'll get to a royal family, and OMG, we can't get enough. Talk about Family Goals. Now I wanna hear from you guys. What did you think of Jay-Z's snapchat mishap or how about those adorable family pics? Sound off in the comments sections below, or tweet me @sineaddevries.

This time Biebs really does NOT deserve the drama but some concerned Beliebers mistook the weed pipe for a meth pipe. Sooo not the same thing. Justin, Cody and One Direction's Niall Horan recently enjoyed some bro time. And since the fun doesn't count unless you post it on snapchat, Cody did just that. He innocently uploaded this video to snap chat. The problem is... he totally forgot about that bright yellow pipe in the bottom left of the table.. and you know, all the green stuff laying around it. Dude, they're just having a musical jam session. Nothin wrong with that! But fans that are not cool with the Mary Jane paraphernalia quickly exploded in the Twittersphere. So Cody was interviewed the next day on the Zach Sang and the Gang radio station and here's what he had to say: ""Dude, someone said it was a crystal meth pipe.... You think I'd be here?"" Meaning if he was doing crystal meth he'd NOT be able to handle that or NAY interview. When asked if he was aware that the pipe was in the shot he innocently: ""Honestly, I didn't.I woke up and realized it was there. I think if I had known when I put it up I probably wouldn't have. Just for the sake of not knowing the other people in the Snapchat situation, who are less open about that sort of stuff."" But the Biebs who is not immune to controversy saw this as the perfect opportunity to give his friend a hard time. ""Bieber texted me, 'You're a f--king idiot.  He was kinda joking, he doesn't really care about that kind of stuff either."" Innocent mistake if you ask me? But what say you, Beliebers and Non Beliebers alike?

Yeah, we're bout to get to the bottom of her high-flying escapades right now. What's up guys, so Kylie, I hate to break it to you, BUTTTT Snapchat stories don't exactly last just 24 hours if you've got the entire world lookin in on your life. So yes, the Snapchat heard round the world came conveniently after Kylie finally admitted to getting lip injections, but this time the news is not about her mouth and more so what actually came out of her mouth. Let's take a look one more time: Yeah if you were able to turn your volume all the way up, you could barely hear the words, ""High as F--k"" come out of her mouth, which was conveniently said seconds before munching on a snack. BUT, you guys, I've gotta let you in on a lil somethin somethin: Jokes on us, because at the time of this Snapchat, Kylie was also with her rumored boyfriend Tyga, in an airplane, and literally high as f--k as in like thousands of feet above the ground, high as f--k. TOUCHE, KJ, TOUCHE. Yeah, so unlike many rumors surrounding the reality star, she has yet to comment on her high-flying Snapchat maybe because she's probably busy laughing at the fact that the media has gone berserk. Just like I'm doing now. AHHH KYLIE, CAN'T YOU USE YOUR SNAPCHAT FOR GOOD, NOT EVIL!??!?!? Anyway, I'm cool, don't worry, it's all good. So what do you guys think about the video, was it just a distraction from her whole fake lip ordeal, or was it just classic Kylie playing a joke on the media?

In a way, it almost makes her just like the rest of us little people, and that's why we love her. So last night when Kylie was taking a drive with some friends, and accidently spilt her drink in the most unfortunate of places, we're pretty happy that she decided to share it with the rest of the world. Wearing a pair of skin-tight high waisted jeans, Kylie got out of the car and pulled up her jumper showing fans her incredibly wet butt. Nah, you can't notice it at all! Buuut this isn't the first time that clumsy Kylie has split on herself. Remember that time when she pulled the car over and used a CVS bathroom after spilling all over her leather leggings? Very, very unfortunate. But hey, it happens to the best of us! In the end, we're just glad Kylie has such a great humor about the whole thing and decides to document it every time.

While Kim K has been taking a stab at her newest form of social media, weird filters and all, it seems as though her daughter, North West has developed a slight case of Visiobibliophobia. No thanks to my pronunciation, but ALL thanks to Wikipedia, this tragic illness is, in fact, the fear of social media. Kim took to her Snapchat to share an adorable video of her and North, while North can be heard saying that she is terrified of the social media app. Take a look: Because who wouldn't get the chills from a flesh-eating bunny filter or a face distortion that makes you question your own physical appearance?! We hear ya North, loud and clear. Buuuuut, Kim being the social media maven that she is, attempted to rid North of her tragic phobia, by actually showing her face in one Snap photo, which featured Kim's infamous duckface pout and North looking like she had just seen a creepy sharp-toothed ghost thing, which if we're talking about Snapchat filters, she probably did. Kim directed an arrow at North writing on the photo, ""Not a Snap fan"" and that came as no surprise seeing that North's face was equally as adorable as it was terrified, but hey, I guess that's one way to push your kid right out of the fear zone... So maaaaaybe we'll be seeing North in more of Kim's snaps orrrr many not. Regardless, her Snapchat debut was one for the books, but I want to know what you guys thought about North's fear of Snapchat and which filter causes you to make the same face as North, so get the conversation going right down here in the comments section below and after that, don't forget to check out our newest episode of Clevver Now, where we break down the coolest, craziest, weirdest things happening in Hollywood.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1c1e51ac840ac74ea2b8"	"Kylie Jenner Sends Scandalous Snapchat Pics!

Today's episode of Clevver News Feed is brought to you by the new movie, The Longest Ride in theaters April 10th! Okay... So for those of you unfamiliar with Kylizzlemynizzl, we are of course referring to Kylie Jenner's username on the popular social media site that we all love... Of course I'm talking Snapchat.  And just in case you missed her recent story... you know... In which she revealed some possible new Nipple piercings... Well, we've got you covered. So although this photo does display all her little hoop earrings leading up her cartilage, (which is totes popular right now) That's not exactly what caught out eye. -As you can tell she's focused on her QUOTE ""new Jewelry, in other secret areas"" ... Where she then decided to circle her nipples, leading us to believe that she did indeed get some new nipple piercings. Now there are a just a few things I want to point out like 1. She was rocking an oversized sweater with the caption "" The Brest Coast""... So like everything is in this photo is in sync with what she's talking about. 2.

"youtube.com"	"Actors with Failed Music Careers >> https://youtu.be/JgMWAJe2N40 More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Kylie Jenner documented a trip to the nail salon where she gave a special shout to her... husband? Kylie Jenner and Tyga are totally back on and maybe this time, there really are wedding bells in their future. We knew it wouldn't be long before the Kylie/Tyga marriage rumors would start flying now that the two are back together and seemingly more in love than ever. But this time, it's Kylie who's fueling the rumors after she oh-so-casually refers to Tyga as her ""husband"" on Snapchat. Kylie and her bestie, Jordyn, took a trip to the nail salon, obviously documenting the entire outing on Snapchat. While Kylie showed off a selection of nail art to her followers, she took special note of some Ancient Egyptian-inspired designs. And that's when her snapchat took a turn. Check it out Whoa, did we miss something? Now Kylie may not have said Tyga's name, and sure she could be referring to somebody else, but we also all know that Tyga loves all things Ancient Egypt. His son is named King Cairo, after all. But hold on you guys, this doesn't mean that Kylie and Tyga are secretly married, but it is pretty cute that she calls him her husband. I guess it's better than pookie, right? So if you had any doubt that the Kylie and Tyga weren't actually back together, I think it's time to jump back on board with Kyga because these two are not hiding their rekindled relationship at all. We've seen more than a couple acts of public displays of affection between the two this week, including a romantic encounter in a photobooth, all amidst talk that Kylie and Tyga are actually living together. So maybe this time is for keeps, and we really will see them tie the knot one day. I'm sure the entire thing will be documented on Snapchat. Now it's time for you all to weigh in. Do you think Kylie calling Tyga her husband is sweet or a little too much too soon?

Selena Gomez is the reigning queen of Instagram, so why hasn't she amped up her Snapchat game, too? She finally explains in an adorable and ironic new Snapchat video. While out and about with friends at dinner for her makeup artist's birthday, Selena rocked her sexy new bangs and Snapped about why she's not on the social media app more often. Take a look... Wait, what?! Her friends don't like it? Who are these friends and how do we hunt them down and get them to stop killing our dreams?! Sure, we've all done things and stopped doing things thanks to some good old fashioned peer-pressure from friends, but when it's something as harmless and fun as Snapchat, Selena should know better to ignore whoever is persuading her to use it less frequently. Because they are wrong, Snapchat IS ""natural"", and they are preventing us from seeing more of Selena's cute new bangs, which is frankly a crime against humanity. Just take a look at them in this adorable Snap she took at the Coca Cola offices... Can she be any cuter?! Also those bangs deserve their own sponsor. Oh wait...they already have one. #BangsByPantenePro-V. But all jokes aside, girl needs to seriously ignore whoever is keeping her off Snapchat, because her Snaps are cute AF, and we need more. So how do you guys feel about Selena not Snapchatting as much? Are you hoping she'll change her mind? Let us hear your thoughts in the comments or tweet me @Ryland_Adams, and after that check out our latest episode of Beauty Trippin where the girls take a Twerking Class.

But on the real, the girl obviously knows how to have a good time. Selena totally stole the show in a series of Snapchat videos that designer Cena Barhaghi released onto her story, and features the girls singing, dancing and havin a good time with a group of friends. In the first clip, Selena was showin off her effortless dance moves with what looks like a game of beer pong going on in the background. In the second clip, it looks like a food fight broke out, because the 22-year-old is seen wearing cake icing all over her face, and I'm asking again, where was my invite?! Check it out: And in another shot, Selena is whippin her hair back and forth, singing Chris Brown's ""Ayo"" into the camera, and it just secured the fact that a Selena Gomez Chris Brown collab would be completely mind blowing. The story ends with her group of friends dancing and singing and having a blast. So I'm not too sure exactly what the occasion was for Selena's epic night that caused us to develop a major case of FOMO, but perhaps she was celebrating the fact that she is about to unleash a new chapter of her life after she even took to Instagram to share a picture saying QUOTE, ""I want to claim my own name"" and talked about how excited she was to show her fans the real her. She said QUOTE, ""I've been keeping so many secrets... I'm reborn in every moment so who knows what I'll become.. As long as I'm happy with me."" And her own happiness is really all that matters, so if Selena's happy, then we're happy!

The Keeping Up with The Kardashian star finally told fans that she has had a secret Snapchat account for months now. But how did she reveal the news we have all been waiting to hear? Well her longtime friend, Jonathan posted a snap to his story where Kim told his followers a very interesting piece of information. Apparently after not being able to sleep one night, Jonathan had her open up an account. But what we really want to know is...Why keep it secret?! Kim said, QUOTE: ""Jonathan told me that if I followed some of our friends and saw what they really do in their real life, wasted and acting so crazy, I would never be friends with them again."" Uh oh, those friends should probably watch out! Kim said her sole purpose of being on there was for a top secret mission, and if you're a fan of Keeping Up with the Kardashian's, you know Kim is all about that spy life. After posting an ""I heart you"" snap, fans are starting to wonder if Kim will start using her Snapchat for more fan-based purposes instead of ""lurking and stalking"" her friends.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1c1f51ac840ac74ea2c2"	"Zayn Drops New Album & Kendall Jenner Joins Snapchat (DHR)"	"youtube.com"	"More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Zayn's solo album has finally arrived and Kendall Jenner has joined snapchat!

Shortly after comments started swirling that it had appeared that the friend was doing cocaine. Khloe was quick to fire back, denying the allegations tweeting QUOTE: """"You guys will make up anything,"" she continued... "" ""No! No one was doing coke at a graduation party in broad day light with teenagers and 15 production cameras! We aren't as wild as you want to believe. We were taking Jell-O shots though and you have to scrape the rim of the shot glass w ur finger to loosen up the jello in order 2 take it. Just say no to drugs kids! Drugs so not our style."" While Kylie seems to frequently get herself in trouble on SnapChat... This one seems to make sense to us... If cameras were rolling, and parents of the recent grads were around... It seems very unlikely that Khloe and the gang would openly be doing drugs! So I'm guessing all of this is just one big misunderstanding! But I'm curious as to what all of you are thinking, do you think the girls pulled a fast one orrrr do you think everyone is just making something out of nothing???

Click here to download now: http://bit.ly/1N6Phc6 More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews here's times where we just can't seem to get rid of them, and then there's times like this where we just can't seem to get enough of their crazy antics, and I ain't sorry about it. The reality star siblings spent the day on Friday completely undercover during a popular Hollywood Tours ride (and I'm talkin' wigs, fake noses, prosthetic skin and ALL). Both Kylie and Khloe documented the entire thing on the Snapchat and livestream, and if you didn't manage to crack a smile throughout the entire ride, well, maybe you need to lighten up juuuuust a little bit... The three were decked out in quite the disguises, Khloe taking on a 79-year-old grandmother from Albuquerque, New Mexico, visiting California with her two granddaughters. Kylie admitted she looks like ""the old Kylie,"" wearing a black wig, fake nose and arm tattoos and Kendall, rocked red curly hair and a face full of freckles, making the group of gals completely unrecognizable. Until, that is, a little thing called Snapchat gave away their disguises, when fans who had been viewing Kylie's snaps somehow managed to catch wind of the tour bus and began yelling and waving at the girls. The tour guide apparently also began questioning the girls saying, ""You guys are more famous than I thought. What did you say you do in Austin?"" Khloe attempted to cover their tracks by saying QUOTE, ""It's Albuquerque. She's impregnated by a really popular YouTube sensation."" As if they need any more rumors surrounding them... On more stops throughout the tour, the guide even brought up a few local hotspots that the famous family was supposed to be known for, like Kim K.'s favorite Chinese Chicken Salad place (to which Kylie denied by the look on her face) and even Kylie's boyfriend Tyga's Grammy after-party to which he allegedly didn't let Paul McCartney in, annnnd you bet the girls had a few words to say about that... But seeing that the trip was documented all over social media, fans along with paparazzi, got wind of the prank, and the girls ended up being chased to their car, by a group of photographers, however the nonstop laughing didn't end there. The sisters even documented the entire facial demolition in the car, Khloe ripping off her wig and prosthetics and Kylie peeling off her fake nose... Kourtney Kardashian and the girls' momager Kris Jenner also took to their socials to give notice to the girls' hilarious prank, Kourtney posting QUOTE, ""Omg!! I have never laughed so hard watching @khloekardashian on @KylieJenner snapchat. I'm literally crying. Khloe you are just it for me,"" while Kris tweeted, ""You guys have to see @kyliejenner's snapchat story today!!! #sofunny #mykidsarecrazy."" Well I think crazy might be a bit of an understatement, but it was pure entertainment nonetheless. So I want to know if you guys were able to keep up the Kardashian/Jenner prank of the weekend and who's disguise you thought was the absolute best, so get the conversation going right down here in the comments section.

The Chicago Tribune reported that police initially thought the shooting could have been an accident given the circumstances, but prosecutors say Mendoza should have known better than to play with a gun.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated throughout. A 15-year-old Florida girl committed suicide after friends allegedly recorded her in the shower, then posted the video on Snapchat. Tampa mom Levon Holton-Teamer told WFLA that her daughter, Tovonna, was upset about the bullying before she killed herself Sunday. Now, according to one friend, Tovonna's ex-boyfriend got hold of the nude recording and posted it on Twitter after they broke up. The couple had been fighting the night before Tovonna died, longtime pal Christian Coyle-Watts told The Daily Beast, and broke up Sunday morning. ""Tovonna knew [her friend] posted the video, but Tovonna's boyfriend posted it, trying to expose her in a derogatory way,"" Coyle-Watts said. ""He did it just because he knew he could, and it would hurt her feelings."" A sheriff's department spokesman told The Daily Beast he hadn't heard of the allegations against Tovonna's boyfriend. Tovonna's mom tried to piece together what happened to her daughter to WFLA. ""Tovonna would say, 'Mommy, I owe them; I owe them'. I said, 'What do you mean you owe them?' I couldn't understand what was wrong,"" Holton-Teamer said. Hours later, Tovonna's mother found her in the bathroom with a gunshot wound to the head around 6 p.m. The high-schooler had apparently used her mother's handgun, which was stashed in her purse, to kill herself."

In fact, the veteran rapper might need to start using Snapchat regularly based on this video with actress Paige Hurd, who he face swapped with on the app last night. While the image of the face swap was just so good, DMX's epic reaction in the video was easily the best part, as acted terrified by the scene on the phone. Even better, they did a face zoom in, which was just as great. This is just further proof that DMX definitely needs to get a Snapchat of his own before the year is up.

Last night Mrs. Grande teased new music via Snap Chat, posting two snippets of an upcoming song that's rumored to be called ""Be Alright."" Many fans are wondering if it could be her second single? Perhaps! or maybe just a teaser for her upcoming third studio album, which we still don't know if it will or won't be called Moonlight. But incase you missed the snaps we have upbeat track right here so check it out Good right! If you listen closely the lyrics go like this ""Don't you worry 'bout a thing, boy we'll be alright!"" Ariana lovingly reinforces those lines which has us thinking that they might be about a special someone! That someone being Ricky Alvarez a.k.a the pop stars back up dancer. Funny enough around the time she teased the song in June was also around the time the world caught her making out with Ricky at the infamous donut shop. Word around town is that Ricky wants to lay low with their relationship after the incident as well he didn't want to mix business with pleasure but he said he just can't fight the feelings he has for Ari. So incase you were still questioning if these two were dating I think this song proves that Grande is reassuring her man that everything is going to be alright! So that leaves us with 3 hard hitting questions. 1. Is this going to be Arianas next single 2. Is the song about Ricky? and 3. Do you like the song!? That is definitely a lot to chew on so I'm going to let you talk it all out in the comments below and if you can't get enough of AG make sure you click right here to see 9 Amazing Hair & Style Moments of hers in 2015.

So if your Friday's been a total 'drag' so far, why not take a look at Kylie taking a drag, because you know that's not about to stir up some major drama or anything... After one of Kylie Jenner's many Snapchat videos featured her smoking an e-cig yesterday, some of her biggest fans are having a hard time inhaling what they just witnessed. The just-short-of 10 second long video features Kylie filming herself sitting in the passenger seat of a car taking a drag out of a vaporizer and then attempting to impress us all by blowing smoke rings out of her mouth... She captioned the video ""VapeLife doggg"" and fans wasted no time in uploading the video directly to Instagram, where many viewers accused her of smoking weed and being a bad influence, writing things like, ""She's such a stoner"" and ""Thought your family was against drugs, maybe not."" Although Kylie has yet to comment on or defend herself from her latest controversy, vaporizers can be used for many other non-nicotine flavored products, so even though this probably wasn't the smartest move, it's not for certain she was actually doing anything illegal. Just trying to offer another perspective. BUT, you guys, in GOOD Kylie news, she has just debuted 10 new lipstick shades from her Lip Kit by Kylie line, so if you missed out on the first two releases of Kylie's lip kit, it might not have been a bad thing after all. She posted photos of her hand decked out in swatches via Instagram and Snapchat of what looks like 10 new colors. Unfortunately for us, Kylie kept the tease game going strong as the images of the shades were all in black and white, but maybe she'll switch things up with some glossy or metallic shades, like the rose gold teaser she previewed last month for ""inspiration"". The possibilities are endless and the anticipation is REAL, but right now I want to know all your thoughts on the whole Kylie smoking controversy: big deal or blown out of proportion? And also let me know which shade of lip color is on your dying wish list, so get the conversation going right down here in the comments section.

Kylie captured the moment on snapchat but it is very unclear as to what is going on. I guess sometimes you just have to get that good stretch in any way you can. The snap was posted by KylizzleSnapchats which is a Kylie fan account, but the video was taken from Kylie's snap story and it shows Kendall in the driver's seat with her leg chillin' out the window while she screams, ""I Fixed it."" Don't try this at home. What did you fix girl? Maybe she had a Charlie horse and was celebrating the fact that she fixed her muscle. Maybe her foot needed to breathe.  It also looks like she got a little twerk in there so maybe she was just feelin the music and the beat took her there. Sometimes when the beat drops you can't help but to whip out a stanky leg. No one knows for sure what the heck Kendall was doing or what she fixed but it definitely didn't look safe. Perhaps she was celebrating because she definitely has a lot to celebrate this week. She announced via social media that she will be appearing in the new Fendi ads for their 2015 fall-winter collection. But what do you guys think if you care?

"youtube.com"	"More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews He made his Instagram debut a few months back, but now Kim's pride and joy Saint West has checked Snapchat off his list... so prepare yourselves for a cuteness overload. Sweet six-month-old Saint West has officially made his Snapchat debut with eyes wide open and the sweetest little cheeks I may have ever witnessed. Kim took to Instagram yesterday to gift the world with the first photo of him in 3 months since debuting her pride and joy wide awake just one month before his first-ever debut at 2 months old, and by then, we could already start to see the Kardashian-West resemblance. Kim also shared the adorable photo throughout her other social media accounts, writing, ""(angel emoji) on my snap chat"" and shortly after took to Twitter to also dub Saint West as her mini-me. She wrote a series of tweets beginning with QUOTE, ""Saint is my twin!"" She then began replying to fans, writing, ""Yeah we have the same eyes. def a good mix of both of us but he is more me, I think. I mean North's baby pics look like mine too but Saint i think looks more like me and North like Kanye."" Although Kim has been rather reserved about posting a plethora of Saint West photos, with this track we're on, there will be plenty more to come in the near future. So right now I want to know which parent you think Saint West looks more like: Kim or Kanye, so get the debate going right down here in the comments section below and after that, click right over here to check out our brand new show called Diss Track where the ongoing feud between Katy Perry and Taylor Swift may finally be resolved... or not.

Take a look: In other words, all other albums should be shakin' in their boots because Justin's album will be the one to beat. His words not mine. But no need to start feelin' some type of way about this. It's clear that Justin was just joking around with a little friendly competition. And plus who's to say that this was directed toward 1D? Right? I mean Cee Lo Green and Ty Dolla Sign also have albums coming out on November 13th so the shade could have easily been evenly distributed. But now that the shade has been thrown, we'll just have to wait until the album sales are in before we determine who will have the last laugh. So what do you guys think of Justin's snapchat shade?

But that's not what's got everyone's panties in a knot. It's the fact that on 4/20, the official Mary Jane, marihuana, cannabis, ganja holiday where all weed lovers celebrate their favorite recreational drug, Snapchat unveiled a Bob Marley filter. Because what better filter to use on April 20th than one of  the man who smoked so much weed during his lifetime that there is literally a strain of marihuana named after him. Insert pic of Marley Natural here. However, some people did NOT think a Bob Marley filter was funny, claiming it's as a modern version of Black Face. Not this chick.

Click here to download now: http://bit.ly/1N6Phc6 More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Judging from Gigi Hadid's latest snap, it's clear the supermodel can't get enough of her boo's hot new album. Just when you thought Zigi couldn't get any cuter, add a Snapchat filter, a newly released Zayn song and you'll basically get all the feels. If you don't know all the words yet to Zayn's newly released solo album, ""Mind of Mine,"" which came out not too long ago, have no fear because Gigi is here! Since the model is dating the former One Direction member, it's safe to assume she has been listening to his album long before we even had access to it. I mean, I don't know about you, but it definitely looks like the supermodel has all the words down to this song. In the video, Gigi is lip syncing to ""TIO"" which no, in this case does not stand for uncle in Spanish. It actually stands for Take It Off. And Gigi is certainly working those lyrics along with the crying filter while her hairstylist busts a move in the background. Clearly Gigi likes to play her boo's jams in the background while she gets ready for a shoot, but do you blame her?? With songs like that, I'd do the same thing too. Gigi and Zayn have been spending a lot of time in New York together over the weekend celebrating the launch of Zayn's new album and she's obviously not tired of it if she's singing along to his songs on Snapchat. The two seem to be going strong as both a couple and in their careers. Seeing as how they've been an official couple for roughly 2 months now and there is no sign of trouble brewing... so I guess that just means my heart will have to wait for Zayn just a bit longer! So, I want to know what you thought of Gigi's SnapChat video! Are you a pro like Gigi or are you still trying to learn the lyrics?

And we know this firsthand after hearing Justin's Snapchat rant this weekend about being hounded NOT by the paparazzi, but by screaming fans who just want to Snap a photo and bounce... JB took to Snapchat over the weekend to deliver over a 60-second rant about why he sometimes doesn't want to snap photos with his fans. None of the video shows Justin's face, but his thoughts seemingly came right after he was disrespected by fans who were shouting at him for a photo after driving away in a car in Australia. Take a look: He followed up by saying, ""If I'm walking somewhere or arriving somewhere and you guys are asking to take a photo, if I don't respond, if I continue to just walk, then the likelihood is that I don't want to take a photo at that moment. Now if you start screaming louder, that's not gonna make me want to take a photo more."" See, it really is simple, guys. Just respect the dude, and hey, even start up a conversation. Justin concluded his rant by revealing that he DOES prefer to get to know his fans. He said, ""Honestly I'd rather stand there and talk to you for five minutes and not take any photos... just have that moment without the chaos."" BUT in the midst of his Snapchat confessions, Justin also confessed to some shocking album news. He recently sat down with Complex magazine where he revealed some shocking news saying, ""I've done probably three or four albums that I haven't released yet. I've gotten all of these different modes, and try to dive into different ideas, and I finally came up with something that was pretty genius."" JB also talked about becoming unrelatable to his fans, but not because of doing bad things. He said, ""Just outrageous stuff. Like, you got a monkey, what are you doing?"" I think we all wondered that too, but Justin did reveal that he owes his new direction in life to his faith, saying that QUOTE, ""Jesus created a pretty awesome template of how to love people and how to be gracious and kind."" And amen to that! But now I want to hear from you guys so let me know what you thought about everything Bieber including his Snapchat rant and how excited you to hear his new masterpiece of an album dropping November 14, so get the conversation flowing right down here, and then don't forget to check out an all-new Beauty Break where we take a field trip to achieve rainbow mermaid Hair.

"youtube.com"	"5 Most Bingeworthy TV Shows (Debatable) >>https://youtu.be/7QXsBCnZtSc More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Harry is just making his way around the entire Kardashian-Jenner family! First he was with Kylie, then Kendall, and now Kourtney??? Yeah, you heard me. After having his fun with Kendall, Kylie, and Hailey in the first part of the movie, Kylizzle's BFF Harry has seemingly moved on to Kourtney...or so we think. Part two of the epic saga starts off with Kylie doing her thing, putting her face on with a little cameo from her popular lip kit collection until she answered a phone call, said ""What you like him now?"" and our whole world turned upside down. Seriously you guys, the story gets even crazier. The person on the other line was none other than Kourtney K! Kourt denied liking Harry and revealed to Kylie that she was simply staying in the same hotel as him and that nothing fishy was going on. But then...this happened. Oh. My. God. If only Kylie knew what was going on behind her back! We then see Kourtney happily skip over to Harry's room and impatiently knocked on his door until he answered. The eldest Kardashian hit Kylie's bff with a playful wink before calling him out on using Kylie and Kendall to get to her. But, before taking it any further, Kourtney covered her bases and made sure that Harry was 18. After he said yes, things started to get kinda sketch. Harry then asked Kourt if she could come in an hour because it was a ""bad time"" for him, but Kourtney being Kourtney, she managed to make her way into his hotel room... Anddd...are you ready for it? The reason why Harry didn't want Kourtney to come in was because HE ALREADY HAD SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS BED! And by someone else, I mean... Dun dun dun, PLOT TWIST! So far, we had Kendall, Kourtney, and Caitlyn appear in Kylie's epic snapchat mini movie...I wonder if Kimye, Kris, and Khloe will make appearances any time soon... What are your thoughts on Kylie's whole Snapchat saga? Do you love it or hate it? Let me know in the comment section below!

Click to see how:  https://youtu.be/RuL635I9JII More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Well, looks like Kylie and Blac Chyna fooled us all. While the whole world believed that these two hated each other; it was apparently quite the opposite of that. So, was there even a Blac Chyna and Kylie feud to begin with? Maybe there was in the very beginning, but these days, it looks like there's nothing but love between Kylie and Chyna. The Lip Kit by Kylie creator revealed their relationship status on Snapchat when she shared a selfie of herself and Chyna with the words ""When we've been best friends the whole time .."" written across it. Not too long after, the mother of one shared a similar selfie of the duo on her own Snapchat and wrote ""Hanging out with my lil sis."" Looks like the days of shade throwing and subtle disses are over for these two. While Kylie did reveal that she and Chyna have been BFFs this whole time, TMZ is singing another tune. According to the outlet, a source revealed to them that it was none other than Kim Kardashian who brought these two ladies together to end their feud. The source told TMZ that Blac Chyna received an invite from Kim to come over and talk about Chyna's recent engagement to Rob. During their chit chat, the two ladies agreed that it was time to end all of the animosity surrounding Rob and Chyna's engagement. But, that wasn't the only thing the two mothers talked about. Apparently Tyga was also brought up in their conversation and Kim managed to persuade Chyna into talk things out with Kylie. The source continued to reveal that days later, Kylie and Chyna talked on the phone and that phone conversation eventually turned the ladies' face-to-face hangout session. Who knew Kim was such a peacemaker? Regardless of whether or not Kim had any involvement in Kylie and Chyna's newfound relationship, I'm sure everyone is relieved that the drama is OVER. So, what are your thoughts on all of this? Do you think Kylie and Blac Chyna fooled us all by keeping quiet on their relationship over the years or do you think Kim forced the two to hash out their issues with each other? Let me know in the comment section below! When you're done with that, click right over here to check out all the drama surrounding Kylie's lip glosses and her response to it!

Click to see how:  https://youtu.be/RuL635I9JII More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Playing around with makeup filters on Snapchat, a trip to Color Me Mine, quality mother-daughter time, could Kim and North's girls' day BE any cuter?? Remember when North used to be scared of Snapchat filters? Well, seems like these days the adorable toddler is embracing them. On her day out with Momma Kim, the two took a few selfies modeling their stylish, yet matching looks for Snapchat, but one of the best things to come from their day out was Nori trying out the makeup filter on Snapchat. How cute is she? Motherhood looks amazing on Kim and even though the reality star is loving her family life as it is, Kim revealed to Khloe on the series finale of Kocktails with Khloe that husband Kanye West really wants more kids. As much as Yeezy wants to add another child to his growing family, he should definitely take into account how difficult Kim's past pregnancies have been. The reality star did reveal in the past that she developed a health complication where her placenta grew onto her uterus when she was pregnant with North, making it riskier to get pregnant and carry another baby safely to term without putting her own life at risk. There are definitely other options for the Kardashian-Wests if Kim and Kanye really want to have another child. While Kim has said no to surrogacy in the past, she could always change her mind if Kanye is able to change her mind. What are your thoughts on all of this? Do you think North and Saint should have another sibling soon or should Kimye focus on their two children for now and revisit that idea later down the road?

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

A huge database of Snapchat photos and videos maintained by a third party has been hacked, and many years' worth of files are being distributed on 4chan. Users have dubbed it ""The Snappening,"" and 13 GB-worth of files (many of them explicit) are now available for anyone to view. The BBC points out that about half of Snapchat's users are between the ages of 13 and 17, so there is justifiable concern that many of the leaked photos and videos will be of minors. It's also important to note that the leak did not come from Snapchat itself; the company pointed out in a statement that: ""Snapchatters were victimised by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps, a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users' security. We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed."" The hack allows people to search the database by username, and appears likely to have emanated from the app SnapSaved (which no longer exists). It's unclear if there will be more celebrities affected by this leak, but it serves as yet another cautionary tale about taking or sending any kind of compromising photograph on your phone.

Khloe Kardashian just joined Snapchat Usually your first snap isn't too complicated. It's usually just a selfie of you looking confused at how this whole world works. Well, Khloe Kardashian went full on pro with her first snap, by not only pulling out the video vibes but also filtering it up. But the surprise in all of this is the fact that Khloe had a very special guest as her first snap chat co-host. Yep, that was Lamar Odom saying hi to Khloe's new snap universe, and maybe it's just the filter, but it looked like to me that he's doing well for now and seems really happy. Us Weekly recently reported that while Khloe has been busy taking care of Lamar and helping him get back on his feet again, but their source has stated that Khloe is definitelly planning on filing for divorce from Lamar for a second time. But hey...regardless of what happens, they seem friendly enough to be snapping together so I feel like that's a success by itself. So, what do you think of Khloe joining snapchat? And what was your very first snap, if you can even remember that far back. Let me know in the comments and after that click right here to get caught up on your latest Ariana Grande news.

Those who see the video ad in the Discover section will be able to swipe up to buy their tickets from either Fandango or MovieTickets.com, Variety reported. Participating channels include People, BuzzFeed, Food Network, Vox, Vice and the Wall Street Journal. For now, it looks like you can only buy tickets for movies about everyone's favorite mutants, but expect to see more of this kind of promotion in the days (of future past) to come. 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the film, also took over Snapchat lenses on Monday by replacing every filter with the X-Men, and people were less than thrilled about it.

Click here to learn all the Spotify Tips and Tricks you never knew existed.  http://bit.ly/1VfW63R Watch more How to Use Social Media videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/149055-How-to-Use-Twitter With Twitter you have the potential to reach millions of users instantly. Use it to issue public safety alerts, broadcast real-time news developments, inform constituents, or solicit feedback. It's free and easy to use - here's how to get started. Step 1: Create an account. Go to Twitter.com and click the green 'Get Started' button to join. Enter your name, user name, password, and email address, and you're good to go. Step 2: Decide what you want to say. In general, Twitter messages, or 'tweets,' answer the question, 'What are you doing right now?' But you can also post a link, express an opinion or reaction, or pose a question. Tip Twitter keeps things short and sweet: Messages can be no longer than 140 characters. Step 3: On the home page, type your message into the box at the top of the screen and hit 'Update.' Congratulations! You've posted your first tweet! Tip If your tweet is intended for one user in particular, type the '@' symbol followed by that user's screen name before the text of your message. Step 4: Twitter is a two-way street. Now that you've posted your first update, choose people whose updates you want to follow. To search by name, click on 'Find People' in the upper right corner and then click the 'Find on Twitter' tab. You can follow individuals, like friends and colleagues, and groups, like news services, organizations, and nonprofits. Tip People may be listed under a screen name that doesn't match their real name. Step 5: Once you've found someone you want to hear from on Twitter, click 'Follow,' and you'll receive their updates automatically. People you already know will often reciprocate and start following you, too. Tip If you have a Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Hotmail, or MSN email account, you can import any contacts that also have a Twitter account. You can also invite someone via email, or scroll through a list of suggested people. Step 6: To help people find you, fill in account information under 'Settings,' such as your location, real name, and a brief bio. You can also add the URL of your web site or blog if you have one. Tip If you want to restrict your Twitter updates to only those who follow you, check the box marked, 'Protect my updates.' You'll maintain your privacy, but you'll limit your reach. To get the full Twitter experience, leave the box unchecked. Step 7: You don't have to be online to use Twitter. No matter where you are, you can stay connected with your cell phone. On the 'Devices' tab under 'Settings,' enter your mobile number to receive and post Twitter updates via text message. Tip Twitter doesn't charge for text messages, but your wireless provider might. Make sure you know the details of your messaging plan. Step 8: On the 'Picture' and 'Design' tabs, customize how your profile appears to others by uploading photos and choosing background themes. Step 9: See what people on Twitter are saying about subjects you're interested in. At the bottom of any Twitter page, click 'Search' and type in a name or topic. Or, either below the search box or alongside search results, check out what's generating the most buzz by browsing through 'Trending topics.' Step 10: You can post updates from the web in the update box, via text message, on your cell phone's web browser using m.twitter.com, or from any third party application. Apps are available at twitter.com/downloads. The more updates you post, the more people will follow you. Now get tweeting! Did You Know? President Barack Obama announced his selection of Joe Biden as his running mate simultaneously via text message, email, and Twitter."

So as you saw, Amanda spends the entire video filming herself in front of a mirror, making peculiar faces, admiring her cheek piercings.

"5758daa951ac842068292c71"	"HMS Hi-tech, the warship of the future"	"youtube.com"	"Sleek and stealthy, it resembles something from Star Wars. In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1c6c51ac840adba59cc5"	"Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas Let Twitter Make Their Decisions"	"youtube.com"	"What happens when Twitter takes over their day?

"youtube.com"	"Taylor Swift's Instagram In Real Life >> https://youtu.be/Jlv4qF7uvKo More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews Shawn Mendes and Camillia Cabello are flirting on Twitter SAY WHAT, I'm about to break it all down right here on Clevver News What better a way to kick off a relationship than to do a little flirting on social media? I think every girl can agree they feel special when a guy talks with them back and forth on a social media platform to show all the other lady followers that he has an interest in them and no one else, am I right ladies? Well Shawn Mendes is doing just that for Fifth Harmony member Camilla Cabello. The teen superstars have been friends for quite some time, but some flirty exchanges between the two on twitter have us all wondering could it be more than just a friendship. The tweets started back in July so allow me to break it down for you First Shawn tweeted out ""Camilla cabello is the worst at texting"" which Camilla fired back and said ""Shawn Mendes i will get better at texting when u go to sleep after 10 pm grandpa"" which he responded ""haha sleep is important"" Ohhh lala it looks like these two obviously talk to one another often, and stay up late doing it! But wait there is more! Shawn tweeted out, ""Going to try to learn Spanish again...haha"" where Camilla slyly replied ""Shawn Mendes don't worry, you'll learn fast because you have an INCREDIBLE Spanish teacher whose name rhymes with Vamila Carmello"" And those are just a few of the tweets they shared! I think the first word Camilla should teach Shawn in spanish should be, seras mi novia when you figure out what that is in spanish send me a tweet @jackie iadonisi But before that I have to know what do you guys think, is this flirting or are they just friends. Afterall Shawn did say in an interview that he would wife up Camilla. Don't believe me, take a look for yourself. Now that you've seen the messages and the video first hand the question is do you think they would make a cute couple?

Is Kylie Jenner following in Kim K's sex tape footsteps? Spoiler: the answer is a hard no. Here's the lowdown: Kylie Jenner's Twitter account was hacked over the weekend on Sunday. The beauty entrepreneur's account has since been reclaimed and she has deleted the racy tweets which included: ""i want ur **** @justinbeiber"" and ""nothing would make me happier than if mikes neck was a little fatter tbh"" and, ""i love being so famous with no talent"". There was also a sweet tweet about Taylor Swift and Katy Perry: ""miss u both @taylorswift13 @katyperry"" which seems to reference the hacked tweet from Katy's account last week. So is this the same hacker? Sounds like a maybe to us. But the most shocking fake tweet of all was this one, ""well my sex tape with tyga was trash"", alluding to the fact that the former couple Kylie and Tyga had made a sex tape that we may never see. But don't worry! Kylie was quick to address THAT rumor on her Snapchat. Well, that settles it. Sounds like a definite NO on the sex tape with Tyga and a big huge NO on a sex tape EVER. And we hope that the case. Kylie's got a lot going for her right now and she doesn't need a scandalous sex tape in her life. In fact, Kylie's sentiment about the Twitter hacking situation seems to agree. She could not be more unbothered, take a look at this snap. So now it's your turn: do you think there really is NO sex tape? And do you think Kylie responded appropriately to the hacking and rumors? Leave so many comments below!

Details on their Twitter fight! http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews - Subscribe Now! http://Facebook.com/ClevverNews - Like Us! http://Twitter.com/ClevverNews - Follow Us! Eminem's 16 year old daughter Hailie Jade Mathers has seemingly CALLED OUT Taylor Swift on Twitter, and it's all over a boy! Hailie tweeted, ""If Taylor Swift is really dating the love of my life Harry Styles, I will not be happy!"" That seems like a bit of a understatement, considering the next round of tweets Hailie sent out. She said, ""Dear Taylor Swift, please stop whoring around with every guy you see. We all know you're only doing it so you can make another album. I am never ever ever listen to your music again, Taylor Swift. LIKE EVER!"" So as expected, tons of Swifties rushed to Taylor's defense, tweeting angry messages to Hailie to back off. That prompted Hailie to apologize and clarify what was really going on. She said, ""Wow, I didn't mean for people to react to my tweet in the way that they have. It was just a bit of fun! Sorry Taylor Swift for my immaturity. I believe I'm entitled to my own opinion, but that got out of control. I don't understand why there are news articles written about it!"" One thing I should mention is that Hailie Jade's account has since been deleted, and the account was never verified. So while it may have been an imposter, many online sites have a strong hunch it was the real deal, because she's posted a ton of photos hanging with friends, and she has a striking resemblance to her parents, Eminem and Kim. It also makes sense because back in May when we told you all about Hailie's Twitter account, she was tweeting up a storm to Harry Styles and seemed like a HUGE One Direction fan.

Millions of users have spent the last portion of their evening last night making any comical reference to Hiddleswift they could think of in regards to Tom's Avengers character Loki, the fact that Taylor has moved on in a span of 5 minutes and even their choice of beach attire. Yeah, it got that deep... but we couldn't help but choose some of the best reactions, starting with one user who couldn't understand why people were hating on how fast Taylor moved on from Calvin, writing QUOTE, ""Y'all think it's bad that Taylor Swift is dating again so soon, but nobody says a word to me when I eat lunch 45 minutes after breakfast."" Another user had a similar mindset, saying, ""Taylor Swift moves faster than me when I hear the microwave ding, and thats pretty damn fast."" And not only was Twitter shocked about Tay and Tom's mouths colliding in what could have been mistaken as a T-Swift romance music video, but also made reference to a combination of other factors, like this tweet that read, ""Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift. The merger of two of the most extra Tumblr fandoms,"" or more importantly combining the names of Tom and his costar, writing, ""Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's names almost combine to make Tilda Swinton and that seems important here."" And as I previously mentioned, users even took the time to examine Taylor's choice of beach attire, when one person wrote, ""The real question is, why are you wearing loafers to the beach, Taylor Swift?"" and because of that, another user made the observation that QUOTE, ""Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift seem like a couple who would ask you to please not put your feet on the furniture."" And then we have the Loki references. OH THE LOKI JOKES, which were my personal favorite by far. One user attached a photo of Tom's long-haired character in The Avengers, Thor, also writing, ""You better call Loki with the good hair"" in reference to Beyonce's Lemonade album. More Marvel jokes were to be made as one user combined Taylor's Bad Blood alter ego and Tom as Loki, saying ""OMG you guys the next Avengers movie looks so good."" Another follower cracked off a simple pun, saying, ""please give taylor swift and tom hiddleston their privacy they're trying to keep their relationship loki"" because you know, Taylor Swift making out on a rock in the middle of a public beach is totally low-key. And speaking of making out, one observant user also took note in the fact that there were no tongues seen in the making of this news report, writing, "".@BuzzFeed You and I have VERY different definitions of ""making out""."" TOUCHE, Twitter person, TOUCHE. But there were some users who couldn't help thinking about Calvin Harris in this situation, who is now just a faint image and a future album in the mind of Taylor Swift. As Taylor and Tom were sitting and posing perfectly on the beach, one person wrote, ""Can't believe they gave Calvin Harris a burial at sea."" Ouuuuchhh... But the beach apparently wasn't the first place Taylor had her eye on Tom. One user attached a paparazzi photo of Tom and Idris Elba with a faint glimpse of Taylor in the background staring not-so-swiftly out at Tom... creepin' is a real habit, Tay. And to top it ALL off, the tweet that sums up the truth about what just went down in the past 15 hours, goes out to The Nerdy Bird, who wrote, ""god what was i even doing before i found out tom hiddleston and taylor swift were dating. it's all a blur."" Because truthfully, I don't know where I'd be today if it wasn't for Hiddleswift. So right now I want to know what your favorite response was and if you think you had a better one, go ahead and share it with me right down here in the comments section below or you can tweet me @miriamisa.

Joaquin Guzman, billionaire head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, made his jail break on Saturday morning and is on the run from Altiplano jail, 50 miles outside of Mexico City, security officials said. His audacious escape saw him dash through the mile-long tunnel system, which led to a building under construction next to the prison - from where he collected clothes left for him by his conspirators.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1c6d51ac840adba59ce6"	"Zayn Malik & Louis Tomlinson's NASTY Twitter Fight - Miley Admits Homosexual Relationship!

Still, it's clear everyone's mind was on his fourth studio album, and rightfully so, as Drake has made it clear VIEWS marks a turning point in his career. Twitter was naturally in a frenzy over the release of VIEWS, firing off memes and #hottakes to last a lifetime. Check out some of the best reactions below.

"youtube.com"	"11 Celebs who've dissed Tswift>>http://bit.ly/1nJ1FDE More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews It all started on Monday when Zayn Malik retweeted this tweet from @femaletexts, showing quotes from Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. The quotes show the artist's different views about the music industry. Taylor's quote was taken from her interview with Time magazine. The quotes show Taylor's opinion on Spotify and streaming music, explaining that she feels artists should be paid for their work. Taylor says QUOTE [People] can still listen to my music if they get it on iTunes. I'm always up for trying something. And I tried it and I didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value place on art. END QUOTE Miley's quote comes from her interview with Marie Claire, where she talks about how she doesn't care if people buy her album because she has enough money.  Miley said QUOTE I've made my money. If no one buys my album, cool. It's fine. I've got a house, and I've got dogs that I love. I don't need anything else. END QUOTE After retweeting the post, Zayn then tweeted ""G statement"" and people assumed he was throwing shade at Taylor. So, when Taylor's boyfriend Calvin Harris saw this, he decided to come to her defense and the defense of the artists who aren't as successful who need to be paid for their work. Calvin tweeted ""@FemaleTexts @zaynmalik You've made your money? Cool...fuck the 99% of musicians who depend on these services to survive right? Yeah fuck em"" Calvin continued by saying ""If u don't get what it means when a successful artist uses their celebrity to benefit every other musician and songwriter in the industry......stay out my fuckin mentions pls"" He then went on to say ""While u kids are refresh voting teen choice awards there's some poor fucker in a basement making your new favorite record trying to survive. Meaning...stay out of things you don't understand"" Zayn saw Calvin's response and tweeted at him saying ""@CalvinHarris ha you just made an absolute fool of yourself mate"" Zayn continued by saying ""@CalvinHarris you clearly didn't understand what I just said either so i suggest you calm your knickers before them dentures fall out"" So much shade! Calvin then told Zayn it wasn't him he was mad at, it was Miley's quote. He tweeted Zayn saying ""all good, it was the quote not you personally mate"" We think Calvin then saw the dentures tweet and wrote to Zayn ""lol"" Zayn then tweeted ""Oh and I write my own shit too dickhead"" Yikes! When Calvin saw this, he decided to take the high road. He responded by saying ""@zaynmalik best of luck, genuinely. You've got a great voice"" Drama! We're glad that's over, for now anyway!

Yeah, that's right, so this is it, you guys. The Twitter feud that just broke out between One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Naughty Boy is what is going to cause the world to stop and I am just not prepared for such a thing. So while I try my best to keep whatever cool I have left, here's exactly what went down. It all started when Zayn took to Twitter to retweet a studio photo of him and Naughty Boy. And that's when the shots were fired... Louis bein' Louis decided to stir things up and tweet, QUOTE, ""Remember when you were 12 and you used to think those Mac filters for your pictures were cool haha ! Some people still do HA!"" Yeahhhh, you can't really disguise that tweet for anything else seeing that Zayn just posted a photo using one of those Mac photobooth filters that is apparently so 2000. So that's when Naughty Boy decided to jump into the mix and get a little naughty by tweeting directly to Louis that he can't sing. That obviously didn't sit too well with Lou because he fired back digging at Naughty Boy riding on the back of someone else's career... But the real tweet that caused Directioners to be sent into a spinning vortex of utter shock and sheer agony was Zayn's tweet to Louis. He said, QUOTE, ""@Louis_Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?"" AHHHH PUT THE WEAPONS DOWN BOYS. So although Louis was clearly the instigator in this mess, Naughty Boy's hands aren't exactly clean either seeing that his caption to the picture said ""replace this"" clearly brought back the fact that Zayn left the band to make his own music and all those aggressive emotions came flooding back. However, we have been seeing rumors going around that Zayn has officially unfollowed the entire band, BUT I put some of my best creeping skills to the test and found out that he has not yet unfollowed them, so there's that bit of kinda-sorta good news for you and I'm hoping this won't ruin their friendship for good and that we can just reminisce to only a few weeks ago when Zayn stood up at the Asian Awards and thanked ""four of the best guys that I ever met whilst being in the band and doing all the amazing things that I did."" Ugh, such happier times... So if you haven't died and gone to One Direction Heaven quite yet, what do you think about this ongoing Zayn/Louis/Naughty Boy fued?! Was it totally out of line for Louis to instigate a fight? I mean clearly there has been beef between Zayn and the band, but do you think they'll ever figure out their problems? In the meantime while I prepare for the world to end because of this heart-shattering feud, get a conversation going in the comments section below or you can tweet me @DanaWardOnline. And then you can click right over here to check out all the other celebs who have dissed 1D... can't we all just be friends?!!

In 2015, the way one identifies oneself on social media says a lot about how one wants to be represented in the world. And well Zayn no longer wants to be identified as a fraction of 1D because he recently changed his twitter name from @ZayneMalik1D to just @zaynmalik. Armageddon. Man this is an everlasting wound that just won't heal. Where's the neurosporene when you need it?? No where to be found apparently because here comes another hit to the wound. Zayn also got rid of his bio quote that once said - ""Just close your eyes and enjoy the roller coaster that is life :) x."" Know what it says now? Nothing. Nothing but England. ENGLAND! Zayn we know you're British, we want corny quotes! Upon Zayn's twitter name change, naturally Directioners started a trending hashtag that said QUOTE - #YouWillAlwaysBeZaynMalik1D. Tears. Since the dramatic change, Zayn has spoken to the people only once via the tweet method saying QUOTE - ""Is speech an extension to our thoughts or an image that we like to create x."" I don't know, will I or will I not cry over your 1D social media breakup Mr. no bio quote??  Stop asking philosophical questions in times of despair like this. I'm kidding guys. All dramatics aside, Zayn can change his social media to whatever the heck he wants. It's really not that big of a deal. Surely the boys will still be friends in real life and the separation of ""1D"" from Zayn's twitter name does not translate into the separation of a bromance so everyone take a deep breath. But I am sensitive to your pain and know you're going through it Directioners so let's talk it out below. Let us know how you feel about Zayn changing his Twitter name and bio down below, don't forget to subscribe to Clevver News, and then click right over here to check out a rundown of how some celebs reacted to Zayn leaving 1D.

You can listen to it here, if by some chance you still haven't gotten around to doing it. The reaction to the song was...not good. While there were some people out there who were still trying their best to defend Meek after ""Wanna Know"" was released, Twitter as a whole was not impressed with it. And specifically, there were two athletes who ripped it to shreds after hearing it. The first was Brandon Jennings. Now, for what it's worth, the Pistons point guard and Meek Mill's manager have traded shots on Twitter over the last week. So Meek probably would have had to release the best diss track in the hip-hop history to get Jennings to give him any props. But after hearing ""Wanna Know,"" Jennings went in on the song. He has since scrubbed his opinion of it from both Twitter and Instagram, but Black Sports Online captured screengrabs of him reacting to the track.

Amanda Bynes address her upcoming surgeries! We've all seen Amanda Bynes tweet here and there about having surgery to correct her nose--and last night, she opened up to explain the whole thing. She started off by telling us that she was born with webbing in between her eyes--specifically, she called it a ""birth defect."" Now, she's in a transition phase, waiting for just the right amount of surgeries to have her nose reshaped to her liking. Amanda tweeted, ""I consider myself to be a hero to have suffered 27 years with a birth defect and to just now have it surgically removed! I had to share my story with you so the media would stop using old photos of me and stop writing lies about me having odd behavior."" She continued, ""I wanted to share my story with you to prove that I'm not crazy, I was just embarrassed. Surgery is a complete miracle for more, nothing can hold you back from living out your dreams. There's a surgery for everything that's wrong with you!"" Amanda said she's having her next surgery next Saturday--if we hear any updates we'll be sure to let you know. Surgery-talk wasn't the only thing on Amanda's mind last night, though--she also flirted it up with her pal, rapper Waka Flocka Flame! She tweeted him, ""I dreamed about you last night!"" AND, she also teased that she'll be at his show June 29th and 30th in Toronto--wonder if she'll be making an appearance on stage and debuting some new tunes? One can only hope.... And lastly, while we're talking about Amanda's singing career, she did clarify on her Twitter, ""I never spoke to anyone at Chinga CHanga Records. I got an offer for a bigger record deal that I'm taking as soon as I get my surgeries."" You guys--I'm leaving this one up to you! Do you think Amanda is setting a bad example by encouraging people to get surgeries for things they don't like about themselves, or, should we just take everything she says with a grain of salt?

Of course, because they're amazing right? Well for one Fifth Harmony member, things didn't end just there. Camila Cabello also separately took home two more awards for her hit collab ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" with Shawn Mendes. Now this is the part where the drama is about to go down. To celebrate the night, Camila's manager, Roger Gold, posted a photo of the singer on Twitter with the caption, QUOTE: ""SO proud of Camila Cabello who won four MMVA's last night and would've been the biggest winner if Drake wasn't Canadian!"" But Lauren Jauregui's mom, Clara, was NOT having it. She thinks that Roger made it seem like Camila was the sole recipient of all four awards. So in her daughter's defense, Clara responded by tweeting, QUOTE: ""Let's get it right two were thanks to Fifth Harmony. Just keeping it REAL."" However not very long after posting the message, Clara deleted the tweet. But of course not before someone screenshot it. Dun dun dun. Now Fifth Harmony fans seem to already be picking sides in the drama. Many came to Clara's defense praising her for being a good mom and standing up for the other girls. But others are on Roger's side because he did in fact post the same photo on his Instagram page with a longer caption, this time referencing Camila as winning four total awards, two in fact with Fifth Harmony and two for her duet with Shawn. Who knows? Twitter does only give you 140 characters to work with, maybe he didn't have enough room to tweet the same longer message out? Either way, Roger ignored Lauren's mom's comment. He even posted a follow up tweet thanking Camila and Shawn for a lovely shout out congratulating them again on the big win. But okay guys, I want to know what YOU think about the 5H drama. Whose side are you on? Do you think this is affecting the girls? Let me know in the comment section below and make sure to send me some love @Ryland_Adams on Twitter.

"youtube.com"	"Paper Towns in theaters July 24! Find Tickets & Showtimes: http://fandan.co/1IjBiOa 2015 MTV VMAs Nominations>> https://youtu.be/VImgHQKhGWw More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews But the calm before the storm had to end sometime, and that time just so happened to be yesterday after Nicki took to Twitter to blast MTV for her VMA nom snub. But of course MTV was not Nicki's only Twitter target. In one of her many raging tweets, the rapper also mentioned women with ""slim bodies"" saying QUOTE, ""If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year,"" and in another tweet said, ""Oh but trust me. I'll be on that stage to collect my awards for vid of the year. Feeling Myself & Anaconda."" That tweet didn't sit well with T-Swift, who was the only other female artist up for video of the year with her hit ""Bad Blood,"" besides Beyonce, and if we're gonna be honest here, got those curves for DAYSS, so how could Nicki not be jabbing at Taylor? Taylor, who hasn't been one to shy away from calling out anyone shaming her character, wrote to Nicki saying, QUOTE, ""@NICKIMINAJ I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot."" AND SHOTS FIRED!!! This obviously set Nicki into a raging spiral, as she then responded back seemingly confused by Taylor's tweet saying, QUOTE, """"Huh? U must not be reading my tweets. Didn't say a word about u. I love u just as much. But u should speak on this. @TaylorSwift13,"" and minutes later followed up with another tweet saying, ""Nothing I said had to do with Taylor. So what jabs. White media and their tactics. So sad. That's what they want."" Taylor being the angel that she is, tried to shed some light on the situation, replying, ""If I win, please come up with me!! You're invited to any stage I'm ever on,"" which she later deleted seeing that Nicki began favoriting and retweeting many of her followers tweets saying things like, ""Believe it or not, there are some things that are so much BIGGER than you, @taylorswift13. You owe @NickiMinaj an apology."" There has been no word from Taylor since her deleted AND possibly misinterpreted tweet, however, one celeb ""accidentally"" found herself in the middle of the feud. Kim Kardashian, who happened to be in Paris at the time, tweeted this photo right around the time of the Nicki Taylor debacle, captioning it, ""Ima let you finish, but..."" Which, if you all recall WERE the words Kanye West used at the 2009 VMAs when he interrupted Taylor's speech. Many fans fired back at Kim, who claims she was completely blindsided. She immediately took down the caption, and wrote, ""Wait wait I'm in Paris it's the middle of the night & I'm posting my Vogue Spain pics not having a clue what's going on in the music world,"" and in another tweet said, ""I'm not trying to shade anyone! That's not my style! I just thought that caption was perfect for that pic! Changing the caption now! #ironic."" .....And for the first time Kim Kardashian was in the wrong place at the wrong time... Other celebs, like Bruno Mars and Taylor's BFF Ed Sheeran, took this time to purposely poke some fun at the situation. Bruno kicked off the war tweeting, QUOTE Ed used his impeccably brilliant play on words and jabbed at Bruno's height (or lack thereof) saying, QUOTE So Twitter has officially blown up with enough feuds for the century and so has my brain because this is all just too much for me to handle right now. Let's just hope Taylor and Nicki have already called each other up and talked this whole thing out and will perform together at the VMAs this year, which I know is a longshot, but hey, I'm sure Taylor would love to add another squad member to her list because there is NO NEED FOR MORE BAD BLOOD PEOPLE. Before I lose any ounce of cool I had left, let me know what you guys think about the whole Taylor vs. Nicki feud of 2015. Which side are you on or are you just hoping this whole thing completely blows over by like yesterday? Yeah, me too. But share all your thoughts right down here in the comments section and after that click right over here to check out the rest of the artists who were nominated for a VMA this year.

The shoes are making the rounds virally, but not the way Under Armour hoped they would. If you're on Twitter right now, you've probably scrolled past this soon-to-be infamous shot of the Curry Two Low, accompanied by a hilarious nickname. The shoes are being likened to those worn by the elderly, nurses, mall dads and Trump supporters. And yes, they did get the Michael Jordan crying treatment. See some of the best jokes below.

To make the bullying matters worse than they already were from yesterday, Snoop posted even more rude memes of Iggy, this time comparing here to the Wayans bros characters in White Chicks, comparing her to Nicki Minaj, and then posting a rude sexual gif implying that she's a whore. Like I said, wayyy too far. Yesterday Snoop posted a meme that showed a picture of the Wayans in White Chicks with a picture of Iggy in the middle that said, ""White Chicks 2 starring Iggy."" He captioned the post, ""Ok last one n Imma leave the bitch alone!!"" But when Iggy responded with a series of tweets to defend herself, Snoop posted yet another White Chicks meme showing one of the Wayans looking distraught saying ""I'm so frickin pissed"" with a caption that read, ""How Iggy Azalea was when Snoop Dog put her on blast."" He then captioned the post, clearly addressing Iggy saying, ""U finished bitch cuz I got a lot more where that came from unfunky bitch u!!"" What the F, man? Where is this coming from? So FYI, to defend herself, some of Iggy's retaliation tweets went like this - ""If I'm a bitch for asking why you are supportive to my face but another way on your instagram then so be it."" She continued tweeting, ""ima be the bigger man in this situation and leave it be."" And ""its like the guy that asks for your number and then says you ugly and a bitch when you say no..."" So Iggy is clearly taking the higher road in this situation and she just wants to know - as we all do - why Snoop is apparently one way to her face, but the polar opposite on social media. And as if the White Chick memes weren't harsh enough, Snoop posted yet another photo, this time of Nicki Minaj sitting by herself with the caption, ""Nicki sitting with other relevant female rappers"" insinuating that Iggy is not relevant - nor are any other female rappers. He captioned the post -""Where is Iggy? Nowhere insight. Fuc the fake n non writers yeah that means u again bitch!! Go nikki go Hoe Iggy hoe!! Sweet dreams cunt."" So Snoop is basically telling off Iggy and calling her fake for not writing her own music. But if you think the Iggy bashing stopped there, unfortunately it did not. Snoop took his cyber bully fest to a whole other level posting a video of a girl meant to look like Iggy engaging in some, let's just say inappropriate sexual activity with this flowery caption with some choice words for Iggy - I'm not even gonna take em on - but he's basically calling her a fake wannabe whore and that her man Nick Young better not come to her defense. Full screen with: ""Iggy suckin dick. Like the punk bitch she is now post some more shit hoe! I'm just Getn started on ya fake wanna b black bitch #wrongnigga2fucwit n yo nigga betta not say shit."" But like any good boyfriend would, he did and he did it in a subtle way unlike some other people. Nick tweeted ""Ain't nobody worried about no SnoopLion. This dude just goin thru a midlife Crisis you Go get convertible yet. OG's out here losin."" You tell em' Nick. And guuuuys, Snoop has responded yet again with a video of himself, saying this. Say bitch, you're f-king with the wrong nigga. And your nigga better check you before I do. Obviously, this whole situation is so wrong on so many levels, and I feel like some apologies need to be flying soon, because despite how you feel about a celebrity or anyone really, this type of behavior is never ok.

Nude Photos Being Released?"

Okay, so die-hard Swifties probably were a bit perplexed when Tay's tweeting patterns were slightly out of whack throughout the last few hours, as we've all become pretty accustomed to the mega-star's normal posts, you know - girlfriend pics, moments with her cats, vacay memories, new cool music info and lots of cooking photos. So when a tweet reading ""Shoutout @veriuser follow him guys' FAVE when done for a follow"" popped up on your feed, if you were like us, you were like ""Uh this ain't our girl TS."" But we knew for SURE that Taylor had been hacked when this tweet popped up a bit later - it simply said ""Go follow my boy @Lizard."" Like as if Taylor freaking Swift, would, #1, ever tell us to go follow ""her boy,"" and #2, let's just keep it real, would Taylor ever seriously have a friend named Lizard??? Uh, yeah I didn't think so. Quickly after the reptilian themed tweet hit the interwebs, Taylor revealed via Tumblr that her Instagram was compromised too - these are a few of those photos - but let's get serious, again would Taylor ever post this - a person on the toilet? Regardless, she's in good spirits, as evidenced by her posting ""hackers gonna hack hack hack hack."" We're also giving Taylor major props for her response to these hackers claiming they have nude photos of her, as she tweeted out: PS any hackers saying they have 'nudes'? Pssh you'd love that wouldn't you! Have fun photoshopping cause you got NOTHING!"" I am so obsessed with this sassy version of Taylor Swift. I should add that @Lizard was threatening to release Taylor's nudes when people donated enough money via bitcoin. Totally gross. And shout-out to Hayley Williams of Paramore for being the MVP of the day (those are Taylor's words) for filling TS in on this whole hack first thing this AM. But can we please go back to this lizard thing really quickly because I can't get enough. From what we know, hacker collective, LIZARD Squad is responsible for this breach - this is the same group that hacked all of Playstation recently. NO big deal. And for the record this lizard person is suspended in the twitterverse for the time being. Anyways, we want to hear from you guys - hit us up and let us know what you were thinking when you saw TS tweeting it up about this lizard character (I mean they could have at least referred to themselves as some sort of cat - that would've been believable) and then click here to see a breakdown of celebs who have crossed the line by dissing our girl Taylor Swift.

"youtube.com"	"More Celebrity News >> http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews 11 guys Demi has dated>>http://bit.ly/1pG2jqN Do NOT mess with Demi Lovato -- especially if you're a member of the pesky paparazzi. The 21-year-old ""Really Don't Care"" singer took to her Twitter account on Monday night to address a photo where she was clearly giving the middle finger. Demi carefully tweeted, ""When are paparazzi gonna learn? If you're respectful to me, I'll be respectful back. Why does it have to be a war of celebs against paps?"" and then ""Of course if you yell horrible things, I'm not gonna work with you. I'll pose if you are respectful and not being bullies."" I mean she does bring up a good point about respect = respect but did make the accusation of calling them bullies. This all went down last night in NYC where Demi made an appearance at the Logo Trailblazer event--looking amazing BTW. It was in NYC that a paparazzo took a pretty low blow by telling her to quote, ""Keep her nose clean,"" a clear reference to her struggles with drugs in the past. That's when Demi flipped the bird -- we don't blame her! She also tweeted to her fans, ""I wanted to stop for my fans today/tonight really bad because I love you so much but I can't deal with how mean those paps are... I always try to stop because I appreciate every single one of you, so if I don't get to you please know I'm sorry and I love you. Sometimes staying strong means not putting yourself in uncomfortable or triggering situations."" Do you think Demi did the write thing here? And click this snazzy video box for 11 guys Demi has dated, cause you can never have too much Demi in your life! I'm Misty Kingma, proud Lovatic and I'll see you soon here on the Internet!

In one of her tweets, Nicki wrote QUOTE If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year END QUOTE When Taylor saw Nicki's tweet, she thought she was being called out, so she tweeted to Nicki saying QUOTE @NICKIMINAJ I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot..  END QUOTE But, Nicki wrote back to Taylor, saying that she was missing the overall message. Nicki tweeted QUOTE Huh? U must not be reading my tweets. Didn't say a word about u. I love u just as much. But u should speak on this. @taylorswift13 END QUOTE Now that some time has passed, it seems as though Taylor has realized she misunderstood the situation. Taylor just tweeted QUOTE I thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I'm sorry, Nicki. @NICKIMINAJ  END QUOTE Nicki responded to Taylor's tweet saying QUOTE That means so much Taylor, thank you. @taylorswift13 END QUOTE When one fan tweeted that they were happy the ladies made up, Nicki tweeted QUOTE I've always loved her. Everyone makes mistakes. She gained so much more respect from me. Let's move on. END QUOTE We should also mention, Nicki also sent a kiss emoji to Katy Perry, after Katy posted a pretty shady tweet directed at Taylor on Wednesday. Can't we just get along ladies?

It appears that that feeling was correct, as there's now footage of Wiz screaming ""Fuck Kanye"" during a show in Argentina last night. In the footage posted by TMZ, Wiz slipped in the 'Ye diss during a performance of his song ""Taylor Gang,"" and it actually drew some cheers from the crowd.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Head coach Richard Pitino didn't say what the players did to deserve their suspensions, but he revealed that Nate Mason, Kevin Dorsey, and Dupree McBrayer were all being suspended for not living up to the ""expectations and standards to which we hold our student-athletes accountable."" Under normal circumstances, that wouldn't be much of a story. College athletes, er, student-athletes get suspended all the time for skipping classes, getting bad grades, and, well, being college kids. But in this particular instance, it sounds like Minnesota might have a big problem on its hands. According to Deadspin, the three players were suspended after Dorsey (pictured above) posted two videos to his Twitter account on Friday night that showed him and another man having sex with a woman. The videos were quickly deleted, and Dorsey eventually deleted his entire Twitter account. But the videos turned into a hot topic on the GopherHole.com message board with several people who had seen the videos describing what was going on in them. Here's one graphic description of what was reportedly on the videos.

We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but it sure seems that way. What's up guys, thanks for keeping it at Clevver News where we're breaking down the latest drama between Demi and Selena. As many celebrity quarrels play out, this one is happening all over social media. Apparently, Demi stopped following Selena on Twitter, and Demi also tweeted out a meme that features shots of Demi from her ""Neon Lights"" video and says: ""Swimming away from your bull shit. Bye Bitch."" DANG! Those are some fightin' words Demi. However, the ""Really Don't Care"" singer quickly deleted the tweet, but come on girl. Don't you know how the Internet works? Once it's out there, it's out there FOREVER. And speaking of Demi's hit tune, she's also been tweeting out images from the newly released music video for the track, establishing that she REALLY DOESN'T CARE... about Selena? The gal pals have had their ups and downs -- like all friends do -- so let's not get TOO wrapped up in this news. And we're no detectives, but if we had to guess, their newly ""on the outs"" status probably has something to do with Selena's reunion with Justin Bieber -- who is a lover of all things weed and sizzurp. Now, call us crazy, but we're sure that Demi is coming from a concerned place in all of this. Both Demi and Selena went to rehab, and Demi is very open about her recovery, so we can understand why she might be frustrated with Selena who has gone back to Bieber and his partying ways. Enough of what we think -- what do YOU think about this reported feud? Do you think Demi is calling out Selena? Sound off in the comments below, and while we're on the subject of the Biebs, click right over here to watch our latest episode of Fashion Face Off where JB is going up against none other than Harry Styles.

With the album literally days away, Kim Kardashian took to Twitter to poll fans on which title is their favorite. Does this mean that whatever wins the poll will be the album title?

The app was developed by Whalerock Industries and although the app is free to download, you have to pay 2.99 a month to access more of the goods. But apparently it's worth it cus people are drinking the koolaid and you're even given a seven day trial period to test the waters. So what do you guys think of Kylie's new app and it going number 1?

On Monday, someone by the name of @2aiden3 took over the account and used the time in control to plug his own Snapchat page, which is sort of hilarious. Drake's unfortunate Twitter hack is only one of many artists and celebrities who have been hacked recently. Last month, Katy Perry's Twitter was hacked when a stream of hateful, bizarre messages began to appear on the singer's official Twitter page. The person behind the tweets took credit for the whole thing and told Perry's 89 million followers, ""haha follow @sw4ylol #hackersgonnahack."" Over this past weekend, a hacker or hackers attacked several other artists including Bon Iver, Tame Impala, Keith Richards, and Tenacious D. Each artist took to their Twitter following the digital assaults to assure their fans that the outlandish tweets that had showed up on each of their accounts were not from them. Bon Iver's Twitter handle was changed to ""@ihavelegcancer"" and posted a derogatory comment about the death of boxing icon Muhammad Ali, according to Billboard. ""Very sorry, everyone. We were hacked. Trying to fix the account now. Stand by,"" Bon Iver told fans following the incident. It's a pretty risky move for the person or people behind these various hacks considering the very huge teams these many celebrities have lined up and ready to handle just these kinds of situations. @2aiden3, there's no doubt Drizzy (and his well-paid team) has their eye on you now, along with everyone else whose privacy has been violated. You can check out the tweets below. We've reached out to reps for Drake on this story and will continue to update as more details come in.

THIS IS AMERICAN IDOL! Ok, maybe not. Welcome back to ClevverNews! Lovatics we've got all the details on Demi's odd Idol surprise and recent Twitter drama. Last night on American Idol the top 7 of season 13 performed, and mid-way through the show Ryan Seacrest announced he had a special friend ""chilling"" backstage that he wanted to bring out to say ""Hi"". What do you do when your US tour is over and X Factor is cancelled? Duh! You cameo on American Idol. After Demi and her new brown hombre hair appeared on stage and did that cute dance, she teased new dates for her Neon Lights tour. For the rest of the show Demi took a seat next to her 'dawg' Randy Jackson on a couch and gave guest commentary. Ryan Seacrest randomly called on her for critiques and thanks to her experience on X Factor, she knew just what to say. While she was all smiles during the cameo, she didn't give all the contestants a positive critique. However, Jena Irene got a lot of praise from Demi, who said she'd like to duet with Jena! (Uh, you should take Demi up on that real quick before she forgets!) And it turns out Demi has always wanted to try out for Idol, she tweeted that she always dreamed of auditioning one day. All this happened one day after Demi responded to a nasty fan comment which crashed Twitter. Demi was bold enough to retweet someone calling her ""Fatty"" and responded to the haters, ""...you don't have to like me cause I love you."" And to Lovatics, ""...don't respond with hate but love and positivity"". Demi should just change her name to Demi Awesome Lovato. Did you love Demi's Idol cameo, or do you think the show just trying to snag a boost in TV ratings? For more proof that Demi is awesome, see her prank Little Mix on tour!

The singer, and Russell Wilson's celibate girlfriend, belted out a flawless ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" but drew the ire of two high-profile members of the media because, in their opinion, she was showing way too much cleavage for a national audience. Predictably, the reaction was swift and hilarious as followers and trolls mocked Whitlock and Bernstein for their prudish views while America watched unpaid ""student-athletes"" make coaches, administrators, universities, and networks millions and millions of dollars while they risked injury and potential brain damage for fleeting glory. Ah, amateurism. Also, let's not forget we were one day removed from the Golden Globes that were watched by millions and featured actresses and performers wearing similarly revealing dresses, but you know how that goes.

Out of the 159 people he follows on Twitter and 74 people he follows on Instagram, the Cavs' social media accounts are nowhere to be seen. Is this a sign that James' days with the Cavaliers could be numbered? Or, is The King playing a trick on all of us? Since a video of LeBron and former Miami Heat teammate/BFF Dwyane Wade working out together surfaced, there has been some speculation that 'Bron 'Bron may want to take his talents back to South Beach, or elsewhere. However, it should be noted that on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, James still follows a bunch of his Cavaliers teammates.

We might know what she did last summer, buuuut this winter might be steering Camila in a whole new course, so the burning question remains: Are they more than friends? We all know Camila and Michael have been friends for ages, and if you didn't know that, maybe you can recall the slightly awkward Twitter interaction between Harry Styles, Camila and Michael back in 2013 when Harry cyber-introduced Michael to Camila, claiming that he's a real nice guy... a failed setup that could possibly pay off two years down the line. And just because I'm on a roll with the investigative work right now, the two also sparked dating rumors earlier this year after they were seen having dinner together. But anyway, back to the present, Michael and Camila have allegedly been hanging out backstage at Jingle Ball this week. After she sent out a tweet last night saying, ""SAN FRAN LETS GO NUTS,"" Michael responded with a sassy remark, saying QUOTE, ""@camilacabello97 don't tell me what to do."" This then sparked a series of hilarious memes between the two that was the perfect form of entertainment last night. Michael quickly tweeted Camila a not-so-flattering pic of his bandmate Luke Hemmings mid-scream, to which she responded with a cropped image of a person with Michael's face. Safe to say Camila won the battle because all Michael could respond was, ""@camilacabello97 damnit."" Touche, Camila. But not only did the hilarious Twitter banter give us life last night, but Camila scored herself a follow from 5SOS' official Twitter AND later liked a tweet sent by the band's drummer Ashton Irwin, SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?! Ok so it could still totally mean they're JUST friends, but we'll be keeping an eye out on any type of blooming CaMichael romance just in time for the holidays. But I'm curious to know your thoughts on Michael and Camila's Twitter chat last night and if you think they're just pals or something more, so get the conversation going right down here in the comments section.

After you watch this video please wash your eyes and ears cuz the devil is at work here. That's what Kanye said, anyway. So last night Kanye changed the title of his long awaited album from SWISH to WAVES, which Wiz Khalifa was NOT happy about cuz according to him, Kanye was ripping the term 'Waves' off of Max B, the Harlem rapper who popularized the phrase ""wavy"" in his music. At one point, Khalifa wrote, ""Hit this kk and become yourself,"" which Kanye took as a reference to his wife Kim Kardashian's initials. That's when Yeezy went OFF! Unleashing his anger at Wiz, insulting his music, his baby momma Amber Rose, aka Kanye's ex, who also weighted in on the matter on twitter. Most of the tweets have since been deleted so pardon as I pollute your souls with these painful tweets. Bro first of all you stole your whole shit from Cudi Second, your first single was corny as fuck and most there after You have distracted from my creative process I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants I screen grabbed those pants and sent it to my style team #Wizwearscoolpants 3rd no one I know has ever listened to one of your albums all the way through 4th you let a stripper trap you 5th I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years 6th don't ever come out the side of your neck at me 7th I am your OG and I will be respected as such 8th I made it so we could wear tight jeans It gets worse. He goes on to say that he's an OG and will be respected as such, that Wiz shouldn't have insulted him cuz he's doing music for all of us... here's more.... 12th You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me 13th You own waves????

WHAAAAAT? 16th don't even hint at mentioning me my family or my wife I am your OG 17th I think you dress cool I wish I was skinny and tall. maybe I couldn't be skinny and tall but I'll settle for being the greatest artist of all time as a consolation Wooooooowwwwwww. What an outburst! Dude was just trying to look out for another rapper! Also, he, Khalifa, has since clarified that when he tweeted KK he was referring to a specific strain of weed called KK. Now after his vicious attack on Wiz, apparently Kanye found Jesus, because he deleted all of the tweets attacking Wiz, writing ""Ima take these down cause it's all about positive energy blessings blessings positive energy blessings.""  ""What's sad is I love Wiz and I love all all my brothers and all people."" ""Man it's a sad a day... Wiz lost 2 million followers since I tweeted. I didn't mean to either him like that."" He also tweeted ""I love the world"" and ""this album is actually a gospel album."" Man... whoever said there was a very thin line between genius and crazy had no idea he was really talking about Kanye West. That man is genius. And this outburst is crazy. Also, yall didn't think Rose wasn't gonna say anything, did you? After the twitter feud she chimed in with: ""Awww @kanyewest are u mad I'm not around to play in ur asshole anymore?"" I'm gonna go download a meditation app and remove this shade that I just read you from my heart. Uh, by all means, respond below or to my twitter @Miriamisa. Please be nice.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1cb551ac840ae8d2d8b3"	"You're Closer Than You Think - LinkedIn"	"youtube.com"	"The future is all about what you do next and we're excited to help you get there.

Sometimes you don't really know those people, you just connected with them because you thought it was a good idea at the time. Well why not just remove them from your list of connections? It's much eaiser to add a connection on LinkedIn than it is to remove one. So here's my quick 3 minute tutorial video on how to remove a LinkedIn contact and delete them from your connections list. This is based on how LinkedIn is structured as of Jan 2014. You may well watch this video at a later date and the buttons may have moved.

Just like offline networking it takes time to build up relationships but it perfect for staying in touch with colleagues. Have you ever Googled yourself?  It sounds a bit vain but it is important to be aware of what clients or employers  will find when they look you up. If you do Google yourself you will probably see that LinkedIn is in the top few results. So what does your profile say about you?  A half finished or out of date entry without a photo doesn't give the best first impression.  In this webinar I am going to go through the benefits of Linkedin, how to optimise your profile and how you can maximise this platform's potential to connect with people and  grow your personal brand. Why use LinkedIn Keep in touch with business contacts It can be easy to lose touch with colleagues when moving companies, these people don't quite fit in the people to friend on Facebook but you would still like to maintain a relationship with them.  LinkedIn is the perfect place to interact and keep track.  If you are in the same industry you may join the same groups and share industry news. Build a reputation as an expert in your field As I was saying before your professional brand is represented online whether you want it to be or not.  But by using the technology available you can easily position yourself as an expert.  Demonstrating your knowledge is easy to do through LinkedIn and I'll explain how you can do this in more detail later in the session. Promote your company LinkedIn has made it possible to add a company page.  There is an option for people to recommend your products and services adding to the credibility or social proof to the courses.  Every time someone recommends one of your products it will show up in their profile for all their connections to see. It is possible for people to follow companies they are interested in. Build a network of new contacts You don't have to personal know people you connect with on LinkedIn.  If you have similar interests, work in the same industry or have mutual contacts it is perfectly acceptable to link in with one you have never met.  It can often be the case you have more in common with someone who works in a different company in a similar role to you than your immediate colleagues. When it comes to your personal network bigger is better.  You never know how people are connected and who they influence. Keep up to date with your industry LinkedIn in is a fantastic place to keep in touch with the latest developments in your industry not only through your connections but through LinkedIn Today which is an aggregated news site.  You can set up your personal preference to the type of stories that are prioritised for you and they show up on your home page. Generate sales leads and find new clients By keeping your profile updated, sharing relevant news from your industry and your company helps you stay top of mind with your connections.  If you are sharing quality content then it will get reshared by your connections widening your circle of influence.  You can also receive recommendations on your personal profile.

This system handles over 10 billion messages writes per day for thousands of production processes. This talk will cover some of the challenges of building and scaling this data pipeline for log data, system metrics, and other high-volume data streams. It will also cover some details of the design of Kafka, as well as some of the particular requirements of Hadoop data loads and real-time processing applications. Jay Kreps is the technical lead for LinkedIn's data team, which is responsible for the site's core data technologies including storage systems, data pipelines, Hadoop, search, social graph, and recommendation systems. He is an original author on several open source projects including Apache Kafka, a real-time distributed messaging system, and Project Voldemort a distributed key-value store.

Revolutionary, transparent, empowering and forward-thinking are just a few of the words that have been used to describe Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Since taking office in 2009 at age 42 to fill Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate seat when Clinton was appointed Secretary of State, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has established herself as a passionate, fearless, and laser-focused presence in Congress.The granddaughter and daughter of two trail-blazing feminists, Gillibrand is a fierce advocate for getting women involved in the issues that matter most to them and making their voices heard; in 2011, she formed the PAC Off the Sidelines with that very mission in mind. And as a wife and mother to two young sons, she's a role model to working moms everywhere. With the release of OFF THE SIDELINES: Raise Your Voice, Change the World, Senator Gillibrand hopes to share her message with a much wider audience.  By telling her story, she aims to inspire all women, no matter their age or socio-economic status, to live their lives with meaning and purpose-- to let them know that women need to lift each other up, and that there is power in the collective. ""Speak up, be heard. You can make a difference"", she writes. More About Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Born and raised in upstate New York, Kirsten Gillibrand got her start watching her grandmother, Polly Noonan, organize Albany women to make a difference. Those early experiences taught Kirsten the values that guide her public service to this day: hard work, idealism, honesty and bold action. As congresswoman, Gillibrand pledged to be honest, open and upfront with the public and always stay accessible and accountable. The New York Times called her commitment to transparency a ""quiet touch of revolution"" in Washington. Shortly after being elected to the Senate in 2009, Gillibrand made her presence felt, leading the fight to repeal ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and overcoming fierce partisan opposition to provide health care and compensation for the 9/11 first responders. This year, she has earned national recognition for fighting the Pentagon over how sexual assaults in the military are prosecuted, creating a unique bipartisan coalition in the process. She is now helping to lead a bipartisan coalition to take on the issue of sexual assaults on our college campuses - all while continuing her successful Off the Sidelines project which supports women candidates across the country. Gillibrand's work led TIME Magazine to name her as one of 2014's ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" and the New York Daily News to place her number four on its recent list of ""50 Most Powerful Women in New York."" Kirsten has also been recognized as one of Newsweek and The Daily Beast's ""150 Women Who Shake the World.""

Unfortunately, you've probably spent untold minutes? hours? days? of your life swiping up on apps in a fruitless effort to do so. The man in charge of iOS at Apple, Craig Federighi, has confirmed that there is no need to bother killing your apps because it won't help your battery life. Mashable reports that Federighi's confirmation came in an email to an Apple customer, who had originally written to Apple CEO Tim Cook. In an email that was later published on 9to5Mac, the customer wrote to Cook and asked, ""do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary for battery life?""

See more business news television shows featuring these experts, as they give their top expert business advice at http://www.yourbusinesschannel.com Pier Paolo Mucelli  Pier Paola Mucelli: I personally have a lot of contacts on LinkedIn; I'm not sure whether I'm number 10 or 11 in the world. I personally think you can use it in two ways you can use business online networks in two ways either you leverage your personal contacts or friend or business associates and keep it relatively small a couple of hundred, two to three hundred and then you can refer to when you want to contact again, your network and share information the other option is to create a very, very large network and by leverage and the huge member base of networks like LinkedIn increase your visibility. We adopted a strategy of going for large numbers, we have a very large eOffice group in LinkedIn it's probably one of the top three and that allows us to attract an international audience. Really I see a business network online as a distribution channel competitively priced for our business services and products. I would say so far the return on investment is a bit higher on pay per click personally for our business but social networks, business networks roughly between 08 is coming close, is giving a lot of web traffic at the moment and luckily they are still relatively free services..

Bright is a job-seeking site that uses its unique scoring system to match employers with people looking for a job. Bright's technology reviews the resume of a job seeker and assigns it a score. The idea behind Bright, according to its website, is to eliminate clutter for those hiring new employees. Rather than comb through countless applications and resumes, a company can use a person's Bright score to whittle down the field of prospective hires. Recode reports that the $120 million sale price includes $32.4 million in cash and the remainder in Bright stock. The report also notes that this is LinkedIn's largest purchase of another company since it launched. This could be an example of the bigger company absorbing its fastest-growing competition. There are about 277 million users on LinkedIn. LinkedIn already has a similar job-matching service for companies in its Talent Solutions feature."

LinkedIn Users in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and elsewhere who mentioned the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre earlier this week found their posts scrubbed by the social networking site. Though LinkedIn has defended its censorship of posts outside of China mentioning Tiananmen Square as ""accidental,"" it's the latest sign that the reach of China's censorship apparatus has spread well beyond its borders to influence content everywhere. The outbreak of the zombie apocalypse in last year's Brad Pitt movie World War Z, for example, was changed from Shanghai to Moscow, and the country that invaded United States in the 2012 film Red Dawn and the 2011 video game Homefront was rewritten in both cases from China to the rather implausible North Korea. Companies may feel that by kowtowing to Beijing they will gain advantages in one of the world's biggest markets. That's not how the Chinese Communist Party does business. Censoring posts about Tiananmen is not doing Beijing a favor that will be returned in kind, it is creating a new set of expectations from which future concessions will be expected. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1cb851ac840ae8d2d8ef"	"News Roundtable!

I have hired paid interns for ten years and often speak on campus colleges on networking and why young people shouldn't try to get a job. That's how I got this nice poster designed by Kyle Ready when I spoke at CBU in Riverside. downloadI am amazed by how many college students in their senior year that are looking to enter the workforce aren't on LinkedIn.  Young people are natives in the world of technology.  I was an immigrant to their world of technology. I embraced LinkedIn as an early adopter.  My largest client last year found me on LinkedIn. College students who aren't using LinkedIn lose their native status and become LinkedIn immigrants. They look like they aren't ready for business. They don't speak my language. And guess what?  I don't want to hire them because I don't want them to train them on Linkedin.  I want to teach them other things. As a solopreneur I want an intern to help me from the get go.  That's my world today.  And the world that today's college students will live in when they are 50.  There are numerous articles documenting that in the near future a large proportion of the workforce will be consultants, freelancers, or temp workers. When I speak to students I advise them to go where you want to be.  If you want to be in business then use the social media channel that business uses and that is LinkedIn. The best way to get a job in the field you aspire to if to engage with the people living in that world. Linkedin provides you with that opportunity.  If you want to work in the future communicate with people that may hire you in the future while you are in the past.  You should start your job hunting a year before you graduate or sooner. I recently met a young man with 500 LinkedIn connections.  He was twenty years old and was soon to graduate from UCI.  I wasn't surprised. Did the 500 plus connections help him graduate early?  Probably not.  I am sure that his attitude of preparing for the future did. I have always said some of the worst career advice for students comes from people in the old normal.  They focus on resume building.  That's all good but resumes don't appear on the internet but your LinkedIn profile does. Today resumes should be infographics or simple websites. Young people today will have many jobs in the new normal or create many companies. The foundation of their success will be their network.  LinkedIn is a simple platform to build it and amplify your voice. In the old normal there used to be simple insights shared that ran like this.  If you saved a dollar a day starting at 21 you would be a multi-millionaire by the age of 65 based on the principle of compounded interest. In the new normal if you connect with one person a day starting in college you can be sure of having lots of social currency and an improved chance of financial currency as well."

I'm going to show you all the little bells and whistles, at least the basic ones, and there's a ton that you can do with this LinkedIn company page platform.  But I'm going to show you the basics, the essentials and what you need to do to get set up, specifically on your LinkedIn company page. We're here, over here, on our Local Pulse Marketing page.  This is the overview page.  And what I want to do is go over here to Admin tools and I'm going to hit Edit. This is your Company Type, your Company Size, your Website URL, your Industry, your Operating Status, Year Founded and also your address.  You can add up to five locations there.  Then you can also manage your administrators here.  There are two options here.  You can either designate users only, if you want to have a firm grip on who is actually able to make edits to your company page and publish those edits or you can set it up so anybody with your domain name as an email address will be able to come in and make edits as well.  So that's that there.  You can manage your admins here, like I said. You can add a standard logo and this logo is 100 pixels by 60 wide pixels.  It just shows the same logo to keep it consistent.  You can add a square logo, 50 by 50 pixels.  This is what will actually show up when you do status updates for your company on the LinkedIn news feed.  Down here is your Company Description and this is where you get to explain how your company can help whoever is on your page, how you can help them solve their problems.  Down here you can list all your Company Specialties.  Keep keywords in mind here.  This tells people more and tells LinkedIn and the search engines about what it is that you do and how you can help people.  You can add your Blog RSS Feed if you want your blog to show up automatically, inside your company page, on your overview page.  And you can also choose to post any of your status updates into the news feed updates as well.  You can choose to do that or not.  We have it selected, Yes. Once you're done making your changes there, you just want to hit Publish.  I'm going to hit Cancel because I don't have any changes to make.  And then the next thing you can do is actually go over to the Services tab over here and there's a lot of cool stuff over here.  You see how we have the overview page.  We have these banners right here.  I have three banners right here.  I have services down here.  Let me show you exactly how to go in and edit all this stuff. Since you're on the Services page right now, you want to click Edit admin and you can create multiple pages for different target audiences, by the way, which is really cool.  That's an advanced training.  This is your overview description right here.  Nothing fancy, just a little bit about what you guys do in your title, about the products and services.  You have all the banners down here.  And this is where you get to put in the links to make the entire banner clickable so you can send your users to your website or to your Facebook page or what have you.  That's pretty much it.  Over on the right side, you can add a YouTube video simply by adding the URL right here for the YouTube video.  Really cool stuff. Go ahead and hit Publish, once you're done there.  I'm going to hit cancel really quick and then I'm going to go check out these other pages.  So let's say I want to go edit the SEO page, for instance.  I want to go click on the SEO page, my Search Engine Optimization page.  You can see it's all filled out and pretty.  I'm going to go over here to the Admin tools again and I'm going to hit Edit.  It's going to allow me to select if this is a Product or Service, what best fits my product, the name of it, specifically, that I use in my company.  Here's an image.  I can make it 100 by 80 pixels.  Here is my description with bullet points and bold and italics and everything.  Key features, you can list all that stuff.  If you have a disclaimer, down at the bottom.  You can add a specific URL to your website, which I have.  You can add people that you can contact.  You can add a specific promotion.  You can add a link that the title becomes clickable.  And you can also add a video about your specific service.  Really, really cool stuff.  Make sure you hit Publish at the end.  I'm going to hit Cancel and come back to my page. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLVZ2fselyo Join our other Online Communities: https://www.facebook.com/LocalPulseMarketing https://twitter.com/#!/localpulsemktg http://www.linkedin.com/company/local-pulse-marketing http://gplus.to/localpulsemarketing Visit our website for more valuable information on our expertise: local small business internet marketing --  http://localpulsemarketing.com Don't Forget to SUBSCRIBE.

The report by Sky News reveals the group can potentially recommission thousands of missiles that Western governments assumed had become redundant through old age.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

The exact question was: Hello! I'm new to IFTTT and only been doing this stuff for 3 weeks. I've already set up a few recipes but I don't see Pinterest in your list?? I created my own Pinterest recipe (yeah, this stuff is addictive!) but the images are not posting properly on my Pinterest board. For example, if you look at the Pinterest account you will notice that some pins had images posted to them and some not: https://www.pinterest.com/launchscore/launchscore-news/ For the pins that DO have an image that was posted on Pinterest, you will notice that it was NOT the featured image that was pulled from the blog post, but rather the image embedded into the post: http://blog.launchscore.com/3d-printing-bringing-jobs-back.../ For the rest of the posts they only have a featured image, ie, only one image and no additional images embedded in the blog post itself. Is this a clue as to what's happening? Or did I setup the IFTTT recipe incorrectly? I wonder if I am missing something in the IFTTT setup. I have attached an image of the IFTTT receipt for Pinterest. Any assistance from the group is appreciated!!!?

If only Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had heeded that advice. Mr. Zuckerberg's Twitter Inc. and Pinterest Inc. accounts were taken over in recent days because he reused a password: ""dadada,"" according to a person familiar with the matter. The password had appeared last month in a database of more than 100 million usernames and passwords stolen in 2012 from LinkedIn Corp., the person said. Mr. Zuckerberg appears to have reused ""dadada"" to log into Twitter and Pinterest, allowing hackers to take over those accounts. The age-old advice to not re-use passwords is particularly timely at the moment. Beyond the LinkedIn theft, there were also recent leaks of 360 million email addresses and passwords belonging to users of MySpace.com. Since May, the website Leakedsource.com, which sells access to the stolen information, has added close to one billion records to its database, a LeakedSource representative said Monday.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

The image-based website Pinterest has updated its search algorithm to help users find more local content. When users in certain countries search for a word, they will now be shown pins that are written in their language and contain links to websites in their language. The website has also introduced search suggestions and a spell-checking feature. So far the update is affecting users in Germany, France, Portugal, Brazil and Japan, but it is expected that it will eventually be rolled out worldwide. Pinterest has reported that the update has had a significant positive impact, with users in the affected countries now discovering and pinning twice as many local pins as before. Pinterest is one of the most popular image-sharing websites in the world, with around 100 million users, 85% of whom are female. British professionals prefer to be contacted via email more than any other method, according to research by Adobe. A staggering 63% said that email was their preferred medium for brands to get in contact with them, with physical mail coming in a distant second place with just 20%. Social media, app and text message came third, fourth and fifth respectively, with just 5% of British professionals saying they favoured these contact methods. The British love affair with email is well-documented. Research by Movable Ink revealed earlier this year that reading emails was the most common activity for UK internet users. Almost 80% said they'd checked their emails in the previous 3 months, with visiting websites for personal interests coming in second place with around 70%. The launch of the Kiwi Premium Advertising Exchange (or KPEX for short) has been hailed as a ""transformative"" move for programmatic advertising in New Zealand. Programmatic ads are those that are automatically bought and placed by software rather than by humans. KPEX will allow advertisers to engage in programmatic advertising, with their ads being placed on quality local publishers such as MediaWorks, Fairfax Media, TVNZ and NZME. KPEX's CEO commented on the launch, saying: ""It's an exciting initiative and the first time NZ media companies have pooled their inventory to provide the necessary scale for a private marketplace. Advertisers want the efficiency of real-time bidding and the certainty that their ads will appear in brand-safe environments next to quality New Zealand content."" People in Iran can now buy from the international ecommerce giants eBay and Amazon. Previously, Iranians had not been able to buy from international retailers because there were no delivery channels set up to import ecommerce goods from abroad. Now, the Iran Post Company has signed a deal with the logistics firms DHL and TNT Express to deliver items bought from foreign eBay and Amazon sites into the country. It is also thought that the deal will allow Iranian businesses to send items abroad, opening up the country to the rest of the world. The move seems to be change in direction from the country's usual mistrust of foreign websites. Earlier this year, Reporters Without Borders criticised the Iranian government for its increasingly strict censorship of websites and mobile apps in the country. And finally, research by ANCOM has revealed the internet landscape in Romania. Around three-quarters of Romanian households have a smartphone, around half have a laptop and around a third have a tablet. Looking at people who have a smartphone, over three-quarters go online using their device every day or almost every day. The research also revealed the most popular activities for mobile internet users in Romania, with browsing, social media and email coming out on top. Instant messaging was also very popular."

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles.

Brunswick Community College's (BCC) Center for Aquaculture and Biotechnology (CAB) has implemented a Biofuels from Algae project as a joint effort between the departments of Aquaculture and Biotechnology.  This included the design and construction of an 1800 gallon photobioreactor system during phase 1 of the project.  Phase II focused on the downstream processing of oil extraction.  BCC's CAB has a patent pending status on this process, which is purely mechanical, easily scalable and relatively cheap to implement.  The final phase of the project (pending funding) will optimize and refine the oil extraction process, which will give us the opportunity to file a full patent, license the patent to industry or develop a trade secret with an industry partner, which will quickly move the process to commercialization.  If the final phase is funded we will also obtain data on the yield of oil production, yield to biodiesel conversion, chemical composition of the extracted oil and determine the best species for use in the process developed at BCC."

In this sense, making curd, bread or wine, which are all microbe-mediated processes, could also be thought as a form of biotechnology. However, it is used in a restricted sense today, to refer to such of those processes which use genetically modified organisms to achieve the same on a larger scale. Further, many other processes/techniques are also included under biotechnology. For example, in vitro fertilisation leading to a 'test-tube' baby, synthesising a gene and using it, developing a DNA vaccine or correcting a defective gene, are all part of biotechnology. The European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) has given a definition of biotechnology that encompasses both traditional view and modern molecular biotechnology. The definition given by EFB is as follows: 'The integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services'.

Companies need gap or bridge financing in the present economic environment to prevent the loss of innovation and scientific advancements that have the potential to lead to life saving cures and treatments.

The conceptual development of the principle of genetic engineering: The techniques of genetic engineering include creation of recombinant DNA, use of gene cloning and gene transfer which helps to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism.When a piece of DNA is introduced into alien organism, this piece of DNA would not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But, when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because; the alien piece of DNA has become the part of the chromosome, which has the ability to replicate.The construction of an artificial recombinant DNA molecule emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic resistance with the native plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium. Stanley Cohen & Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at specific locations became possible with the discovery of 'molecular scissors' - restriction enzymes. The cut piece of DNA was then linked with plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as vectors to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it. Plasmid is used as vector to deliver an alien piece of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with the plasmid vector became possible with enzyme DNA ligase, which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created in vitro and is known as recombinant DNA.When DNA is transferred into E. coli, it could replicate using the new hosts DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple copies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli was called cloning of antibiotic resistance gene in E. coli. 7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for K-12.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1dd551ac840b08d62ae0"	"Biotechnology"	"youtube.com"	"This is one of a series of videos on genetics.

Introduction and Overview- Biotechnology: Panacea or Pandora's Box SG"	"youtube.com"	"Given the rapid recent advances in genomics, agriculture, transgenic biology, stem cell research and other related areas of biotechnology and a prediction that these fields will continue to mature and become increasingly more sophisticated, there is an growing need to create an informed and educated student in this area. We believe that a working knowledge of DNA, genetics, and biotechnology has become  as fundamental to a basic education as an understanding of the solar system.  In addition, biotechnology fields offer students career opportunities which is best recognized early in their academics so that they can make the appropriate choices to be best prepared. The rise of recent controversy and misconceptions about many areas of biotechnology including GMOs in food, vaccines and vaccination, personalized medicine, stem cell research and many other topics creates a growing educational challenge. The introduction of a general education course which concentrates on evidence based knowledge on biotechnology and is developed for a general audience with a large potential enrollment is designed to meet that challenge. In turn our experience shows that such a course serves to recruit new scientists and other participants into the careers in the emerging new fields of biotechnology and stimulates further interest in STEM related disciplines. The courses in this series have been established in the curriculum over the past several years with high student demand and interest. Given the scope and impact of biology and biotechnology currently and into the future,  there are few general courses that are more socially relevant. ""Scientific issues permeate the law.  I believe [that] in this age of science we must build legal foundations that are sound in science as well as in law.  The result, in my view will further not only the interests of truth but also of justice."" (US Supreme Court Justice Breyer, 1998). The introductory biotechnology course presents the basis for biological life, and describe the tools for the way we work with life in the fields of biotechnology. First, in Part I of Issues in Biotechnology, the basic questions What is Life? and How does it work? are examined.  How do we go from DNA to an organism that can discuss it?; let alone engineer it. To address these questions, the fundamental mechanics of biological life, DNA, gene expression and cloning are presented in basic terms as a basis for the current applications of modern biotechnology.  Evolution is described for how it happens at a molecular level. Next, in Part II the current basic techniques used for gene cloning, DNA sequencing, PCR and gene transfer are examined.  These technologies provide the basis for biotechnological advances in agricultural, medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, environmental, and forensic applications. Applications of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering are explored in these areas that are dramatically affecting our society and future.  Lastly, the implications of biotechnology to world economy, politics, careers, ecology social concerns and ethics are also discussed. This lecture provides an Overview of the Course.  The first lecture gives an overview of the Course as it is presented in two major Sections.  In Section  I. The basic questions: What is Life? and, How Does it Work? Are addressed.  From DNA to Life, The Mechanics of Life and General Biotechnology provide a foundation for the next question; -How Do We Work With Life? Including; Gene Cloning, PCR and DNA Sequencing. In Section II. The Applications of  Biotechnology looks at The Way We Work With Life; Incorporated throughout the course are the Ethics and Social Concerns which surround these important and socially relevant applications and ideas.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

He is also Editor-in-Chief of Rejuvenation Research, the world's highest-impact peer-reviewed journal focused on intervention in aging. He received his BA and Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1985 and 2000 respectively. His original field was computer science, and he did research in the private sector for six years in the area of software verification before switching to biogerontology in the mid-1990s. His research interests encompass the characterization of all the accumulating and eventually pathogenic molecular and cellular side-effects of metabolism (""damage"") that constitute mammalian aging and the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage. He has developed a possibly comprehensive plan for such repair, termed Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which breaks aging down into seven major classes of damage and identifies detailed approaches to addressing each one. Dr. de Grey is a Fellow of both the Gerontological Society of America and the American Aging Association, and sits on the editorial and scientific advisory boards of numerous journals and organisations. http://www.tedxvienna.at/ http://www.facebook.com/tedxvienna November 2, 2013 at Volkstheater Wien, Vienna, Austria.

Nez-Mujica will be presenting on Science, Innovation and entrepreneurship in developing countries, specifically in Venezuela, where he is from. He decided to stay there, instead of going abroad, to do some cheap biotechnology that is useful to people, solves unmet needs and allows us to use our knowledge for more than academic purposes. The conditions there are very different from the conditions in developed countries. In terms of politics, as well as due to logistic and legal issues, some of those differences are drawbacks, while others can be treated as advantages. He believes that open source models could thrive in underdeveloped countries such as Venezuela and create successful examples of private initiative in places where the public sector runs almost everything. The presentation is less of a detailed analysis, and more of a personal perspective and account of the experiences in his lab with a current project: A kit for Chagas disease diagnostic, plus an overview of the general situation and the opportunities it offers.

Advanced drug delivery systems are having an enormous impact on human health. Dr. Langer will begin the lecture by discussing his early research on developing the first controlled release systems for macromolecules and the isolation of angiogenesis inhibitors, noting how these advances have led to numerous new therapies. For example, new drug delivery technologies including nanoparticles and nanotechnology are now being studied for use treating cancer and other illnesses. Dr. Langer will next discuss ways of developing novel microchips for drug delivery, elucidating how approaches for creating new biomaterials are evaluated and providing examples where such materials are used in brain cancer and shape-memory applications. By combining mammalian cells, including stem cells, with synthetic polymers, new approaches for engineering tissues are being developed that may someday help in various disease, particularly in the fields of cartilage, skin, blood vessels, and spinal cord repair. Robert S. Langer is the David H. Koch Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His work is at the interface of biotechnology and materials science. The major focus areas include the study and development of polymers to deliver drugs, particularly genetically engineered proteins, DNA and RNAi, continuously at controlled rates for prolonged periods of time. Dr. Langer has written more than 1,240 articles, and he also has 1,026 issued and pending patents worldwide. His many awards include the United States National Medal of Science, the United States National Medal of Technology and Innovation, 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Charles Stark Draper Prize, Albany Medical Center Prize, the Wolf Prize for Chemistry and the Lemelson-MIT prize, for being ""one of history's most prolific inventors in medicine.""

First day on the job, enter the gene-weaver. My future colleagues look up from the PCR machine, checking me out man. The Ph.Diddy's on the scene. So I claim my pipette and pimp it up to halt the theivin'. Get the thermocycler going, my samples cool chilling. Yeah, I shoot tips like I've been here all my life. Waiting for instrument time with my free pizza slice. I run my first Western blot. Man, this lab scene is easy. But wait up, hold a minute. I'm feeling kinda queasy. Is that Trizol I can smell? Oh, my head's in a spin! 've gone and dropped my freakin' sample in the biohaz bin. He's a super fly grad. Life plans to shape the future, that's right! Sees his name in lights and a centre spread in Nature. All right! I'm always splitting cells, always working late. I've cleared the biohazard bin so much I herniate. Got samples botched, samples lost, samples dropped on the floor. Messy benches, empty buffers, lab politics galore. My PI's buggin'. Man he sounds like my father. Western blot once again, but development shows nada. I'm doin' my time in the cell culture hood - at the weekend bro. It's the only time I could! Then suddenly my data is starting to make sense. Even Western blot bands start to make an appearance. So I repeat once again all the steps I need to follow. But every culture well... turned yellow. He's a super fly grad. Life plans to shape the future, that's right! Sees his name in lights and a centre spread in Nature. All right! I'm talkin' 'bout the ooh, ooh... Serum and media get swiped with no apology. And all my cells are showing abnormal morphology. So now my PI's freakin' ""Find something you can prove!"" But contamination aggravation knocks me off my groove. So I stay late once again as the lab detainee. Yeah, its 9 pm but the thermocycler's free I don't understand! What's happened now? That's it. Yeah, time to give up. I'm throwing in the towel. Ooh, ooh, supergrad. I'm talkin' 'bout the ooh, ooh... Super bad lab grad, yeah! Ooh, ooh, supergrad. I'm talkin' 'bout the ooh, ooh... Super bad lab grad, yeah! My transfection worked - confirmed with Pol II chIP - mutagenesis determined the TF targeted. I'm not going down!  I can still do BioChem! My genes will express, I'm gonna beat it out of them. And yeah, I must have results that no one can undress. And quickly move my paper from in prep to in press. I'm finally finished writing the discussion, whilst my PI once again, ""tweaks"" my introduction. So, here we go, yo. Here's the scenario: Peer review's due to hit. When exactly? I don't know. My paper will be published. My research is legit. OK it's not quite Nature but, I think I nailed it! He's a super fly grad. Life plans to shape the future, that's right!

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1dcb51ac840b08d62a6d"	"Make in India - Biotech"	"youtube.com"	"From vaccines to gene-therapy, whatever you want to make: Make in India."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

You can follow us on: Facebook http://bit.ly/9GKbIM Twitter http://twitter.com/AshdenAwards Blog: http://www.ashdenawards.org/blog/latest BIOTECH has succeeded in tackling the problem of the dumping of food waste in the streets of Kerala through the installation of biogas plants that use the food waste to produce gas for cooking and, in some cases, electricity for lighting; the residue serves as a fertiliser. To date BIOTECH has built and installed an impressive 12,000 domestic plants (160 of which also use human waste from latrines to avoid contamination of ground water), 220 institutional plants and 17 municipal plants that use waste from markets to power generators. The disposal of food waste and the production of clean energy are not the only benefits of BIOTECH's scheme. The plants also replace the equivalent of about 3.7 tonnes/day of LPG and diesel which in turn results in the saving of about 3,700 tonnes/year of CO2, with further savings from the reduction in methane production as a result of the uncontrolled decomposition of waste, and from the transport of LPG."

The report by Sky News reveals the group can potentially recommission thousands of missiles that Western governments assumed had become redundant through old age.

Glowing animals and plants seem to be all the rage these days. A biotechnology company based out of St. Louis recently unveiled a commercially available plant that is entirely auto luminescent. For years, Dr. Alexander Krichevsky, Bioglow's founder and chief scientist, has been studying the molecular biology of plants in addition to the bioluminescence of aquatic bacteria. All the hard work paid off. His newest creation is being referred to as the ""world's first auto luminescent plants"". While glowing plants have been introduced in the past, the way in which they derived that lighting effect was due to chemicals and UV light. Bioglow's offering gets the glow from the undergrowth of the plant. DNA forms found in nature are utilized, similar to the type of light fireflies emit. Said a spokesperson at Bioglow ""the auto luminescent plant's light emission machinery is encoded on a cellular level allowing the plant to constantly emit visible light during its life cycle."" Krichevsky's goal in developing the plants is to develop ""more sustainable, cleaner and affordable light sources""."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

A USDA agency ruled on the most popular variety of Roundup Ready sugar beets.  The agency said the genetically engineered sugar beets do not harm the environment or increase threats by pests. The Monsanto Company makes Roundup Ready crops.  The genetic change in the sugar beets makes them resist the herbicide or weed killer known as Roundup. The action lets growers plant the genetically changed sugar beets if they obey certain rules.  The USDA agency expects to finish its full environmental study of the sugar beets by May of next year.  Then it will decide if it will permit unlimited planting of the crops.  Sugar beets provide about half of America's sugar supply.The government agency had unconditionally approved the genetically engineered sugar beets in two thousand five.  But after legal action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California cancelled the agency's approval last year.  The court said the Agriculture Department needed to perform a complete study of the environmental effects of the sugar beets. Jim Greenwood leads the Biotechnology Industry Organization.  The group represents more than one thousand biotechnology companies and other organizations.  Mr. Greenwood says the current decision is a reasonable step.  He says it lets farmers make planting choices while the environmental statement is being completed.                      But activist groups for the environment and food safety question the product's safety.  They will take legal action in the same federal court that issued the ruling last year.   Lawyer Paul Achitoff of the organization Earthjustice said he expects to be able to challenge the recent decision before the district court.  The Roundup Ready opponents say genetically engineered crops can cross-pollinate and damage other crops.  And they say the crops can cause the growth of weeds that resist Roundup.

The court rejected a lower court's decision to ban the sale of genetically engineered alfalfa seeds until the government completed a study of their effects on the environment.

President Washington proposed that congress create a department of agriculture in 1793, to conduct research to improve farming practices. This was the same year the English Parliament established their department of agriculture. Congress rejected Washington's efforts, largely because southern planters saw no need for such an agency. In 1862, congress passed, and president Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, known as the Morrill Act. This act granted 160 acres of government land to those who wanted to begin farming or ranching. It also created the Land Grant Act that promoted the development of 59 Colleges of Agriculture and Mechanics in all states. Also begun under this act was the Agricultural Extension Service, which provided technical advice to farmers. While the 1862 act was not as successful as anticipated, more than 367,000 parcels, and 58,700,000 acres were homesteaded by 1890. The second Morrill Act was passed in 1890 and added 17 new colleges of Agriculture and Mechanics. The 1890 act extended the Agricultural Extension Services to blacks in Confederate states and homesteading into the Oklahoma territory. In 1932 homesteading was furthered with a massive land redistribution program at the height of the Great Depression. While all of these programs had serious shortcomings, they all represented serious government subsidies designed to support agriculture. Between the First and Second World Wars, several commodity crops received government subsidies to ensure that in times of natural disaster or war the farmers would produce enough staple crops for the population to survive. In those days, the major subsidized crops were corn, cotton, wheat, oats, sugar, and tobacco. Our current farm subsidy programs are modern vestiges of earlier government initiatives to provide commodity crops in times of national crisis.

Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA at specific locations became possible with the discovery of the so-called 'molecular scissors'- restriction enzymes. The cut piece of DNA was then linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as vectors to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it.

Instead, plants like potatoes are reproduced using a process called cloning.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

It could be a great tool to overcome limitation of human needs. Application of biotechnology for human is on the summit which is emerging and has been proven. It has a really great prospect to get involved into. For example, having twins is possible with 99.99 % of chance by using biotechnology. People could determine their offspring, whether it's a twin, male, or female with the best criteria they want. In medical aspect, biotech improves medicinal intake by creating edible vaccine and nano syringe.  These ensure a better safety and comfort in order to erase negative term of medication. Also, biotech could forecast human's future by fingerprinting their DNA profile. It'll show your potential, including risk of disease. This shall provide better living for human so that it's possible to live a longer and healthy life. All of these examples of applied biotechnology show that biotech is highly important for human lives. Since it's highly emerging, we have a great chance to enter this field and be succeeded.

Specifically, after a layer of steel powder is spread across the base of a ""build box"", a special print head moves back and forth over the layer, and deposits binding agent at specific points, as directed by a computer and your design file. Once the layer is finished and it has been dried via powerful overhead heaters, a new layer of powder is spread, and the process begins again. In this way, layer by layer, from the bottom up, your part is created. Once the printing is done, the build box is placed in a curing oven and your part is sintered. The extra powder that was not bound, and is not part of your design, is then removed. At this point, your part is still very fragile. This so called ""green state"" will be the base of some of the design rules and limitations that follow below. Finally, via the use of a flute system, your design is infused with bronze, which replaces the binding agent. Your part is now solid metal, and after the flutes are manually removed, it is tumbled and polished to produce a smooth finish.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/9CwQhg ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: Ever since Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1439, we have been obsessed with creating the perfect printer to preserve and put our ideas on paper. The printing press was probably one of the most innovative and life-changing inventions as it made literacy more accessible. No longer did people have to write and transcribe thousands of pages, one at a time. But instead, books like the Bible could be mass produced at a quick pace. Over the hundreds of years since Gutenberg's invention, the printer has evolved into devices like the typewriter and the laser jet printer. But today, in the 21st century, the printer has taken a dramatic turn that will change our society just as much as Gutenberg's printing press changed his society: the 3D printer. This isn't science fiction, this is the real deal, and it's coming to a home or business near you. The 3D printer is a technological breakthrough that involves a computer communicating with the printer to create layers as it ""prints"" a 3D creation from the computer. Layer upon layer is laid down as the object comes to life. Stemming back to the 1980's, the 3D printer has gone through many trials, tests, and breakthroughs, and they are now becoming available to the regular household market. Today, you can do more than make a 3D printing of that flower you designed on your computer. People have started to print functional guns, cars, and houses. All it takes is some patience and intricate design. This can be both good and a bad thing, especially since guns can now become available to nearly anyone who can print them at home. In Japan, 3D printers have become available on the streets where people can have 48 cameras take a photo of them, and then create a little 3D figurine of themselves. It's quite an interesting device and people can create 3D figures of celebrities, animals, objects, and more. 3D printing can even create food, and nursing homes are taking advantage of it because they can create softer foods that look like real food. The 3D printing world has also made a huge impact in the medical field, as custom prosthetics can be printed as well as other body parts like bones. This will be able to cut the cost of manufacturing prosthetics and can make body parts more accessible to the disabled. Speaking of the medical field, just like how food can be printed, doctors are also experimenting with the printing of medications. Pretty soon, you won't need to stand in long lines at the pharmacy and you can print your medications instead. Believe it or not, this is just the beginning of the 3D printing world, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Just like how the internet slowly crept into our lives, this amazing type of technology will likely be in every household in the next decade. It truly is looking like our lives will be something out of a science fiction film or comic. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our Social Media: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.org Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheRichest_Com Instagram: http://instagram.com/therichest ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Featuring: Guns Miniature Self Prosthetics An Eagle's Beak Body Parts Medicine Cars Food Houses 3D printers ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Music Track: Future Shock ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For more videos and articles visit: http://www.therichest.com/"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dcX41EQ1JTo/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/dcX41EQ1JTo"

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

I never get tired of thinking about all the possible applications, like building a brand new coffee table, or building a brand new 3D printer, or finally getting that Strickland action figure everyone's been asking for. But all of these great products have one thing in common - rigidity. That means they're going to keep that shape once I print them, unless I take a flamethrower to them, or maybe a hacksaw. But the advent of something called 4D printing could turn all of that on its head! That's right, it's one ""D"" better! Actually, it's not just a catch phrase, 4D printing is really about using a 3D printer to print out self-reconfiguring, programmable material. Now imagine this. You have a non-living object that can change its shape and behavior over time. It's kind of like a robot, but there are no microprocessors, no circuit boards no motors - in fact to you it looks like a string of plastic. But you toss it into a kiddie pool, and upon contact with water you now have a secret message spelled out in plastic cursive! Skylar Tibbits, the man who really came up with this idea of 4D printing, has gone even further. He's created programmable sheet material. It's a sheet of plastic that, when submerged in water, can clench up into the shape of a cube. And a cube is just the beginning! More complex designs will mean millions of more shapes - like self-folding origami! In the near future, imagine a smart grid of plumbing, with pipes that can actually expand and contract in response to water demand. Or maybe even heal if there is a frozen segment that breaks open. Or imagine self assembling furniture. Print out a flat board and just add water, next thing you know it curls up into a rocking chair. Now, wrap your mind around how useful this would be in a really hostile environment, like low Earth orbit, where building stuff comes at a high cost and a high risk. Now the prototypes we have seen so far have been pretty simple, but the promises are amazing! Think about it on the really big scale. What about skyscrapers and bridges. If we could make them out of smart materials like smart beams and smart bricks, they could heal themselves after weather damage or prepare for something massive like an earthquake. Or we flip it. We go on to the very small scale and now we have micro particles moving around in our bodies, maintaining our health. You might be wondering, how much complexity can build up our of stuff that changes its shape without computers or electromechanical motors. Lets think about proteins for a second. Proteins are pretty much what make any basic animal function possible on a cellular level. And a protein is really self-reconfiguring material. It's a polypeptide. It's a long chain of amino acids. So once again we're playing Copy Cat to mother nature. Now lets not get ahead of ourselves, I'm not actually suggesting that we're going to be printing out some sort of plastic replicant that can gain self-awareness and yearn for more life But maybe we will.

This video is one in a long series of my journey into the Reprap Project. I hosted a kickstarter listing that raised the money for me to build my own 3D printer. The first kit I bought was crap and I ended up buying some Reprap parts for a Prusa mendel. (Those pink ones) After a few days I was up and printing. I had several problems and I fixed most of them by the time I shot this video. I use a Makergear hot end 0.5mm  nozzle and a Gen6 board that came with that first crappy kit. 3D printing is a powerful new tech that can partially free us from the costly and wasteful supply chain. I no longer need to buy cheap plastic adaptors, knobs, handles, bottle openers, coat hooks, vases, gears, clips, doorstops, figurines, toy blocks. The list can go on... check out thingiverse.com for thousands of items. Mastering your own 3D printers is not as easy as you might think. The machine might be perfectly built but the code you feed it may cause some bad prints. Like a race car and a bad driver. At this point I had felt like I had master my printer but I always find something I can do better and it changes everything."

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577f1eff51ac840b24cf31b4"	"3D printer can build a house in 20 hours"	"youtube.com"	"More about this video Read: http://gee.by/ba4rc"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ehnzfGP6sq4/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/ehnzfGP6sq4"	"577f1eff51ac840b24cf31b5"	"Top 5 3D Printers You may Want || 3D Printer"	"youtube.com"	"Please don't forget to Like this video and Subscribe to our Channel. http://goo.gl/wfWOMM Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5BuzzInventions/ 3D Printer in Action : Top 5 3D Printers that will blow your mind.

We are proud to provide information and resources about smart glasses and smart technology. We hope you find the information provided here useful as we continue to explore new emerging technology. Once the realm of science fiction movies, computer technology has moved to glasses, and multiple companies are making plans for this emerging mobile peripheral wireless market. The first smart glasses are projected to be available in the summer to fall of 2012 with other companies potentially releasing their versions by the end of 2012. Smart glasses will incorporate a bright high-definition display, adjustable for outdoor use on the glass lens so that the images appear as if they were in the exterior world. They will also have Internet connectivity and multiple new applications. Some of the displayed images will have a holographic quality to them, depending upon the smart glass manufacturer, making the image appear as if it were real and in front of the smart glasses 2)leap motion:- The Leap Motion controller is a small USB peripheral device which is designed to be placed on a physical desktop, facing upward. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, to a distance of about 1 meter (3 feet). The LEDs generate a 3D pattern of dots of IR light[14] and the cameras generate almost 300 frames per second of reflected data, which is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion controller software using ""complex math"" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.[15][16] The smaller observation area and higher resolution of the device differentiates the product from the Kinect, which is more suitable for whole-body tracking in a space the size of a living room.[17] In a demonstration to CNET, The Leap was shown to perform tasks such as navigating a website, using pinch-to-zoom gestures on maps, high-precision drawing, and manipulating complex 3D data visualizations.[17] Leap Motion CEO Michael Buckwald told CNET: Leap Motion initially distributed thousands of units to developers who are interested in creating applications for the device. The Leap Motion controller was first shipped in July, 2013 3)3D printing :- 3D printing or Additive manufacturing[1] is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes.[2] 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes). A 3D printer is a limited type of industrial robot that is capable of carrying out an additive process under computer control. While 3D printing technology has been around since the 1980s, it was not until the early 2010s that the printers became widely available commercially.[3] The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp.[4] Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines, and their price has dropped substantially.[5] According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.[6] The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, 4)transparent phone :- processor - which is said to be faster than the current Apple A4 processor. One more rumor about the iPhone 5 is that it will come in two variants - one with a QWERTY keyboard. But one source says that the iPad 3 will have the A6 processor - is the macroscalar processor the same? Which begs the question: ""Will the iPhone 5 have the same CPU - or an A5?"" A patent search does reveal that Apple is the owner of five patents of the macroscalar processor architecture. The latest is 8,065,502 and is dated November 22, 2011. Apple may even hold the copyright on the term as it appears to be new to our language. The new CPU concept seems to be a ""looped parallel program 6)flying car new technology :- Flying car technology is turning a dream into reality"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tqKpk1wABuI/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/tqKpk1wABuI"

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

The objects are interesting to look at and interesting to touch but aren't useful in any way except for one aspect, which is the main reason I acquired them. Seeing and touching these objects really helps to expand the imagination and stimulate new ideas for what this maturing 3D printing technology will enable. They are creative aids and help to generate new ideas for other structures and objects that you might want to design, build, and create.

In 2013 ESA, working with industrial partners, proved that 3D printing using lunar material was feasible in principle. Since then, work continues to investigate the technique. The shielding against radiation provided by a 3D-printed block of simulated lunar regolith was measured, providing important inputs for next-stage designs... Soon the Agency is due to investigate another lunar 3D printing method, harnessing concentrated sunlight to melt regolith rather than using a binding liquid. But how might lunar 3D printing one day be used in practice? Foster+Partners, contributing architectural concepts for the original study, put together this outline of a hypothetical mission to 3D-print an entire a lunar base, illustrating the design factors that steered them in their work. The rim of Shackleton Crater at the lunar south pole was chosen for the base location. The Moon's rotation is such that the Sun only grazes its poles at low angles. The result is a near-constant 'peak of eternal light' along the rim of Shackleton Crater, beside regions of permanent shadow. Building in the vicinity of such a site would offer plentiful solar power, and relief from the extremes of heat and cold found across the rest of the Moon. In reality any lunar base remains firmly on the drawing board, but each small step forward in research makes future lunar colonisation a little more feasible. In October 2014 more than 350 experts came together for a two-day Additive Manufacturing for Space Applications workshop at ESA's ESTEC technical centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. They discussed the potential of 3D printing - also known as Additive Manufacturing - to transform the way the space industry operates and begin preparing common standards for its use.

Look no further than the high volume of smartphones churned out on a seemingly weekly basis, with a new Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy warranting a press conference to introduce incremental upgrades over their predecessors. Some new technologies, however, change the future as we know it and open a world of possibilities. The line separating human beings and robotics continues to blur with every passing day as we delve deeper into new innovations. If you're not convinced at the leaps and bounds we've made in technology over a short time, some of the creations in this video may change your mind and have you either excited for what tomorrow will bring or running for the hills for the eventual robot takeover ala I, Robot. Should we be thrilled or concerned that human enhancement via robotic implants is now a possibility? If the military starts using exoskeleton suits to mitigate the perils of war, should we revel in the progress or express concern over the potential danger such a powerful creation can induce? Will mind-controlled prosthetics supplant our natural limbs if they dispose of restrictions in strength and mobility? And if so, how will that affect other aspects of our lives, whether it is in the workplace or elsewhere? These debates will be commonplace as we inch closer to a future dictated by technological advancements. Society is always looking for the next breakthrough to sweep us off our feet and generate buzz. Stagnation is avoided like the plague and this will either prove to be our saving grace or our biggest downfall. But why fret over our long-term well-being when we can marvel at new technologies and imagine what the distant future will bring? No matter which side of the fence you land on, it's difficult not to watch with bated breath as technology progresses at an exponential rate. The technologies featured in this video range from impressive to ground-breaking, each serving a purpose in facilitating daily tasks and providing improved convenience. Take the JIBO robot, for example, which acts as a social companion in the household and helps with everything from clerical duties to snapping family portraits. There's also the much discussed 3D printing, which gives us the capability of creating three dimensional objects such as working guns, organ models, and so on. Will such an ambitious innovation create chaos in the wrong hands or help us embrace a world of endless potential? Much of the creations in this video may spur such questions and trigger emotional responses. Embrace it, dispute it, make your case whether you're for or against such innovations in the comments section. But these are just a few of the futuristic technologies that exist today, so without any further ado let's check out what the rest have to offer.

One of them is making vasculature, the blood vessel plumbing system that delivers nutrients and remove waste from the cells on the inside of a mass of tissue. Without these blood vessels, interior cells quickly suffocate and die. Scientists can already grow thin layers of cells, so one proposed solution to the vasculature problem is to ""print"" the cells layer by layer, leaving openings for blood vessels as necessary. But this method leaves seams, and when blood is pumped through the vessels, it pushes those seams apart. Bioengineers from the University of Pennsylvania have turned the problem inside out by using a 3D printer called a RepRap to make templates of blood vessel networks out of sugar. Once the networks are encased in a block of cells, the sugar can be dissolved, leaving a functional vascular network behind. ""I got the first hint of this solution when I visited a Body Worlds exhibit, where you can see plastic casts of free-standing, whole organ vasculature,"" says Bioengineering postdoc Jordan Miller. Miller, along with Christopher Chen, the Skirkanich Professor of Innovation in the Department of Bioengineering, other members of Chen's lab, and colleagues from MIT, set out to show that this method of developing sugar vascular networks helps keep interior cells alive and functioning. After the researchers design the network architecture on a computer, they feed the design to the RepRap. The printer begins building the walls of a stabilizing mold. Then it then draws filaments across the mold, pulling the sugar at different speeds to achieve the desired thickness of what will become the blood vessels. After the sugar has hardened, the researchers add liver cells suspended in a gel to the mold. The gel surrounds the filaments, encasing the blood vessel template. After the gel sets it can be removed from the mold with the template still inside. The block of gel is then washed in water, dissolving the remaining sugar inside. The liquid sugar flows out of the vessels it has created without harming the growing cells. ""This new technology, from the cell's perspective, makes tissue formation a gentle and quick journey,"" says Chen. The researchers have successfully pumped nutrient-rich media, and even blood, through these gels blocks' vascular systems. They also have experimentally shown that more of the liver cells survive and produce more metabolites in gels that have these networks. The RepRap makes testing new vascular architectures quick and inexpensive, and the sugar is stable enough to ship the finished networks to labs that don't have 3D printers of their own. The researchers hope to eventually use this method to make implantable organs for animal studies.

The 3D printer builds up the model from bottom to top, layer by layer. A roller puts a thin layer of powder on a platform and a print head places tiny drops of glue at specific locations, printing a thin layer of your model. The platform lowers and the roller spreads another layer of powder. Coloring is done by combining 4 different pre-colored glues to match the color requested. After the printing process the model is brittle, but is strengthened by putting it into superglue. A UV coating is sprayed on it to prevent de-coloration by sunlight.

Leave a comment and I will be bringing one of my special fans to the Pixar campus. Lee Unkrich, director of Toy Story 3, recently Tweeted about behind the scenes of the five-time Oscar-nominated movie. He gives a tweet out to Z Corp printer. Pixar used their 3D printing technology to create models of the characters we see in the film. Warren Trezevant was gracious enough to show us around their 3D printing studio. I the video, he explains how the 3D prints are the most precise replication of the actual characters. You can't buy a toy this real! The Z Corp equipment creates the characters in full color. The 3D printer that made this model uses inkjets very similar to the ones in commercial printers and sprays the ink onto an off white surface that is similar to plaster. It is very exciting to see the 3D data from those films now being used to create the Disney Pixar zoetrope. Subscribe for more videos behind the scenes at Pixar."

Their printer is CLIP's biggest (and fastest) competitor. According to Diego, it prints the same sphere as the Carbon3D (6.5 minutes) in 4.3 minutes. It works without oxygen permeable glass so there is essentially no size limitation and it's non-dependent on specific resins. It utilizes a provisional patent which is described as a ""dead-zone"" to replace the glass layer. The build from CES uses what appears to be an off-the-shelf projector, but SLA would also be an option. Next, they are working on metal 3D printer which he claims will be twice as fast (as other metal printers?). We are certainly excited to see where this technology goes in the next year!

But 3D printing has challenges: it is still too slow and expensive. His most asked question from users is, ""How can we get our stuff faster?"" HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) Technology is a disruptive 3D printing technology for a new era of manufacturing, delivering higher productivity and quality at a lower cost: * 10 times faster(1) speeds--HP's proprietary synchronous architecture can image an entire area versus one point at a time for breakthrough build speeds. * Breakthrough economics(2) --Area-wide imaging and fewer steps drive improved performance for best-in-class total cost of ownership, and helping reduce energy and waste.(3) With a unique combination of quality that combines strength, accuracy, resiliency and finish for an overall product that is not currently possible at the speed and price HP is planning to deliver to market, HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) Technology resolves the fundamental limitations of current 3D printing systems. And with new levels of part quality, full-color 3D print solutions, an open platform for materials innovation, complete end-to-end solutions and the reliability born of decades of HP product development expertise and printing leadership, HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) Technology is designed to advance and disrupt the 3D printing market. (1) Based on internal HP testing of part build time, for a set of representative parts in batch process comparing HP Thermal Inkjet based HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) technology to the leading 3D printing technologies in the U.S.--selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling--as of October 2014. (2) HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) technology leverages proprietary HP Thermal Inkjet technology, enabling lower cost systems that output similar quality to more expensive devices--such as selective laser sintering (SLS)--and speed. (3) Compared to selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling technologies, HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) technology can reduce the overall energy requirements needed to attain full fusing and reduce the system requirements for large, vacuum-sealed ovens. In addition, HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) technology uses less heating power than SLS systems for better material properties and material reuse rates, minimizing waste. Finally, the combination of breakthrough economics and speed amplifies the total cost of ownership advantage of HP Multi Jet Fusion(tm) technology."

There we caught up with: Hod Lipson, an engineering professor at Cornell University, who compared the excitement swirling around the 3D printing industry to what it felt like to work in the computer industry in the 1970s. Brian Quan, the president of X-Object, who predicted that 3D printing will transform everything from toys to screwdrivers by making possible a ""new organic creation process."" Aleph Objects' Harris Kenny (a former Reason Foundation policy analyst), who discussed the power of open source design and how 3D printing is allowing scientists to create cheap prosthetics and lab equipment. Liz von Hasseln, the creative director of food products at 3D Systems, who demonstrated the new Chef Jet, which is the first 3D printer for pastry chefs. Scott McGowan of Solid Concepts, which created the first 3D-printed metal gun. For more on how 3D printing will change the economy, read Greg Beato's column from the April 2014 issue of Reason magazine. About 7:20 minutes. Produced by Jim Epstein; hosted by Naomi Brockwell.

Each photopolymer layer is cured by UV light immediately after being jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately. The gel-like support material, which is specially designed to support complicated geometries, can easily be removed by hand and water jetting.

Happy Halloween 2013! Whats up Nerdgasm Fans! This is my very first print ever done on my new Robo 3D printer. I had a very limited amount of sample material that was included in the printer to work with so I had to think small. And since it was Halloween a grumpy pumpkin was the only rational choice... Right? This model was printed at 30mm/sec with 1.75mm filament on a 70c heated bed with 220c PLA at 0.15mm layer height and I think it came out pretty good. The few little defects with the model had to do with contamination of the material I was using since it had tape holding it together and the adhesive from the tape got attached to the PLA and wouldn't come off. Once that contamination was burned off the rest of the print went flawlessly. You can see I didn't have to use painters tape or kapton tape because the PLA stuck right to the heated glass without issues. I painted the pumpkin using acrylic paint from the hobby store and my painting skills are obviously horrible but I love showing you guys everything even if it turns out horrible because that's how I learn and it should be how you learn too (and give you something to laugh at on the internet). I hope you guys enjoy the video and tell your friends!

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

The print volume is 100x100x100mm with a cold bed made of polyacrylate. Hot end is a E3D clone for 1.75 PLA or ABS filament with 0.4mm noozle. Using very cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motors in all axis and geared extruder, Arduino Mega 2560 with Ramps 1.4 and modular RepRap construction based on Mendel, Printerbot, Prusa i3 and CARP Box ideas. It is designed to use 12V 40W PSU for LED lights that should fit under bed (on video not embedded yet). Power consumption is ca 40W when heating hotend and 15W-20W when printing. On this video, bridge test calibration model is printed. During this particular print it is reaching top speeds  30mm/s in X and Y axis, 0.35mm/s in Z axis and extruder can push filament up to 4mm/s. But such speeds require higher current, so the motors are overheating and eventually the internal gear box or 28BYJ-48 may got damaged. For a reliable long print, printer should not exceed 12.5/s in X and Y axis and 1mm/s on extruder with as low current as possible so the real speed will be close to the first layer on the video.

The project uses the latest technologies in 3D computer animation, 3D printing, 3D modeling and mobile geo-location to observe, analyse, understand and interpret historic buildings and the people and artifacts associated with them. Focusing on eleven sites across the UK, including one in Staffordshire, the project is bringing a new energy and shape to these iconic buildings, so they can, once again, play an important part in their communities. The project is also using the latest geo-location technologies to create innovative mobile apps which allow the user to discover hidden secrets in their neighbourhood. The De Montfort team is working with the Wolverhampton Civic and Historical society to create the ""Blue Plaque app"" which shows the location and details of Blue Plaques commemorating famous people, events and buildings in Wolverhampton.

"youtube.com"	"The Deltaprintr is a new take on efficient, high-resolution 3D printing. Take your designs to new heights! Support them on Kickstarter: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shai/deltaprintr-a-simple-affordable-3d-printer Deltaprintr was engineered to be simple, efficient, and affordable. We want as many people as possible to be able to get their hands on this exciting new technology without having to sacrifice quality or user-friendliness. Why Deltaprintr? SIMPLE - Using a 3D Printer shouldn't be a hassle. We designed our printer so that it requires minimal set-up, and so that there's effectively no long-term maintenance. We'll be shipping every printer with a construction manual (pictures!) to get you up and running in no time. EFFICIENT - The polar coordinate system allows for faster movements (than those of traditional Cartesians printers) while achieving a 100 micron resolution. AFFORDABLE - Because a Deltaprintr design doesn't need as many parts as other 3D printers, we can pass the savings on to you. About the Deltaprintr The Deltaprintr uses three stepper motors, located under the acrylic build platform, to control the carriages that move the hot-end. Both the drive reels and the bearings that the carriages ride on are manufactured via high-precision CNC machining. The minimal carriage design allows you to simply slide the assembled carriage onto the extruded aluminum beams without having to make any adjustments. The Deltaprintr also uses 65lb Spectra fishing line instead of expensive belts to control the carriages. The Spectra line also makes it easy to expand the build volume - all you need to do is buy longer aluminum extrusions, which cost a few dollars. Every printer will be fitted with an automatic calibration probe, ensuring that prints stick to the bed and don't warp when printing. In addition, every printer will also come with an LCD display and a compact 60 Watt laptop-style power supply. Benefits of a Deltaprintr Faster speeds 100 micron resolution Automatic calibration - no more manual calibration Ease of use and assembly Easy & expandable print volume PLA plastic - biodegradable and food safe LCD and SD card included Compact power supply Getting Started Guide We're already working on an assembly manual so that backers can look it over before their Deltaprintr comes in the mail. For those new to 3D printing, we'll be sure to walk you through the software end of things too. We understand that 3D printing may seem overwhelming to beginners but it's really not that bad! We'll have more detailed instructions on creating your first 3D print on our website after the campaign ends. The Deltaprintr is a new take on efficient, high-resolution 3D printing.

"youtube.com"	"3D printing Technology is growing very fast upto the level of printing a building itself. A professor is working on technology named as Contour Crafting which can print an entire 2,500 sqft house in 20 hours. Behrokh Khoshnevis is a professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering and is the Director of Manufacturing Engineering Graduate Program at the University of Southern California (USC). He is active in CAD/CAM, robotics and mechatronics related related research projects. He was able to make a printhead that can extrude wet cement in such a way that the cement is able to keep its form as each successive layer is printed. Using the Contour Crafting (CC) developed by Behrokh Khoshnevis , a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, embedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing and air-conditioning. The professor believes that his technology would make the construction of efficient buildings so cheap and efficient that we could print houses for Millions of  poor people living in slums across the world. And, this kind of building process will avoid the killings and injuries related to construction accidents. Apart from printing Houses, Contour Crafting can be used for building habitats on other planets. Contour Crafting will most probably be one of the very few feasible approaches for building structures on other planets, such as the Moon and Mars, which are being targeted for human colonization.

Now technology is blurring the line between medical devices and sculpture. US designer Scott Summit is using a 3D printer to create a customised type of cover for a prosthetic leg. He said: ""I was always amazed it (the prosthetic) never looked like the sculpture I thought it should. They looked very utilitarian, like they came from engineers. They solved the mechanical function very well but they didn't really address the human part of the equation. And I thought that perhaps this is where design really wants to come in and change things, make things so that you see it first thing in the morning and you get excited because you can't wait to show it to the world."" The person's existing leg is scanned and the shape of the prosthetic cover is created. It can be customised with different materials - leather, chrome, heavy-duty plastic - some people even choose patterns, snakeskin or a tattoo. Once the 3D computer scan is complete, the printing begins, building up very thin cross sectional slices until the final piece is complete.

Tommaso Ghidini, Head of the Materials Technology Section at the European Space Agency, might have an answer. Tommaso and his team have already come quite close to realising this goal with some mind blowing 3D printing results.

I have had a number of issues with it, the biggest of which was a warped X-axis motor mount which you can see in two of my other videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNtHlmY-9l0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHESM9cUK24 In addition to the X-axis motor mount, I had issues with the LCD screen and the extruder heating element just died on me for no reason one day. I did some testing and determined that it was the heating element itself that was dead and not the circuit board output or the wiring. After much back and fourth with customer support in China, I was finally able to convince them to send me replacement parts. They sent me the new X-axis motor, extruder heating element, and LCD screen/cables via expedited shipping so it only took about 4 business days to get to me. I appreciate them doing that for free to attempt to right this situation. I got the parts in yesterday and put it all back together today. After successfully running the bed leveling wizard and printing out a nice level square around the bed, I decided to print the test file that comes with the printer, which is a 4-leaf clover cup of some sort. So, I am FINALLY able to print parts after several weeks of frustration messing with this thing. The LCD screen is still having issues as you can see in the video. I sent them pics of that so we'll see what they decide to do about it. Keep in mind that this is my first 3D printing experience. While this seems like a decent kit once the bugs were all worked out, I wouldn't recommend it for your first 3D printer. The reviews on Amazon pretty much said the same thing.

Fabricated describes our emerging world of printable products, where people design and 3D print their own creations as easily as they edit an online document. A 3D printer transforms digital information into a physical object by carrying out instructions from an electronic design file, or ""blueprint.""  Guided by a design file, a 3D printer lays down layer after layer of a raw material to ""print"" out an object.   That's not the whole story, however.   The magic happens when you plug a 3D printer into today's mind-boggling digital technologies.  Add to that the Internet, tiny, low cost electronic circuitry, radical advances in materials science and biotech and voila!  The result is an explosion of technological and social innovation. Fabricated takes the reader onto a rich and fulfilling journey that explores how 3D printing is poised to impact nearly every part of our lives. Readers will meet pioneering teachers, small businesses, artists, surgeons and researchers who are applying 3D printing and innovative design software to expand the limits of what they do Non-experts will learn the basics of 3D printing technologies and design software as explained in lucid, non-technical language Readers will learn about weird and wonderful applications of 3D printing such as printing food, dental crowns and someday...  replacement heart valves, organs and joints Readers will gain insight into a whole new level of intellectual property challenges as 3D printers enable people to make copies -- even ""edit"" -- commercial products and works of art Readers with a taste for science fiction will glimpse a not-so-distant 3D printed future that's taking shape as leading researchers explore ways to 3D print smart materials and ready-made robots Aimed at people who enjoy books on business strategy, popular science and novel technology, Fabricated will provide readers with practical and imaginative insights to the question ""how will this technology change my life?""

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"577f1f0951ac840b24cf3230"	"The Collective Project: Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a Real Bionic Arm"	"youtube.com"	"Robert Downey Jr. and Albert Manero, a #CollectiveProject student who founded Limbitless, surprised a very special child with a new bionic 3D printed arm at no cost to the family.

If you want one for yourself, I've put it on: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:114468 Keep away from the blades, they bite! White blades are ""Intake"" Blue blades are ""Compression"" Pink blade is ""Power"" Green blades are ""Exhaust"" Intake, Compression, Combustion/Power, Exhaust Air is blown against the pink/Power blades, this spins up the inside turbine, (in real life it's usually an electric motor.) Connected to the Power turbine are the Compression blades, these spin up as well and compress the air into the combustion chamber. When the air is compressed enough ""Fuel"" is added and ignited. This burns and expands, forcing the power turbine to go faster. The burning air/fuel also hit the ""Exhaust"" blades; these spin the ""Intake"" blades which push air onto the ""Intake"" blades, which pushes air into the ""Compression"" blades. Once the jet is running the ""Start"" is turned off. This turns the whole thing around and on the end of the shaft is the BIG fan you see when you walk out to your aircraft. The reasons the two fans go in different directions are to cancel out the torque. If they both went in the same direction they would have to push against something to turn, and that would twist the engine off the wing."

Back us on Kickstarter now: http://bit.ly/Get3Doodler facebook.com/3Doodler twitter.com/3Doodler Many thanks to Glass Ink Media LLC and Peter Desiderio, as well as the following (in order of appearance) for all your 3Doodling inspiration: Sekiguchi Aimi, @Tanneroo, Mindy Nam, Darryl Bedford, @makeupvanessa, Ecco Pierce, The Official Rainbow Girl, Matt Butchard, SHIGO, Daichi Ito, Rachel Goldsmith, Linda Giampieretti, and the teachers and students of St. Augustine's. Music: The Big Picture by Olive Musique. ++++++++++ When we first launched the 3Doodler we asked the world to imagine a pen that could literally draw in the air. Two years on, we've made the world's first 3D printing pen even better, with a new and improved version that's slimmer, lighter, quieter, and even easier to use. The 3Doodler heats, then rapidly cools plastic, allowing instant 3D creation; and with no software or computers, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. We've shipped over 130,000 first generation 3Doodlers; and our community has used them to create amazing things: from jewellery, to RC planes, fully 3Doodled dresses, architectural models, and even writing braille. It was because of the support of this Kickstarter community that we were able to make the 3Doodler dream a reality. To say thank you, we've decided to bring 3Doodler 2.0 to you first! Completely redesigned from top to bottom, and housed in a sleek aluminium casing, the new 3Doodler is the result of over two years of research and development, all aimed at giving you the best 3Doodling experience possible. The new 3Doodler is also packed with loads of enhancements, making it smoother, sleeker, and easier to use than ever before. We're also releasing exciting new accessories, including the JetPack, a portable power pack that gives you the freedom to 3Doodle on the go. To help kickstart creativity in the classroom we've created a special educational bundle - complete with pens, plastic, accessories and curricular materials - which you can send to any school, library or makerspace of your choosing. If you can draw, write or wave a finger in the air you can create with the 3Doodler. Our Community website has hundreds of projects and stencils that you can download for free; and it's filled with how-to videos and images of inspiring creations from around the world. So when will you get your new 3Doodler? We'll start shipping to our first backers within a few weeks; and the majority of you will be 3Doodling by April. We can't thank you enough for joining us on this amazing journey."

We're building Autopilot to give you more confidence behind the wheel, increase your safety on the road, and make highway driving more enjoyable. While truly driverless cars are still a few years away, Tesla Autopilot functions like the systems that airplane pilots use when conditions are clear. The driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car. What's more, you always have intuitive access to the information your car is using to inform its actions."

I think it's very important to stay on top of technology even though it might not be easy to learn new things. My goal is to create some very accessible tutorials for the 3Doodler in order to encourage everyone (especially girls who may not typically be interested in gadgets) to learn about 3D printing. Difficulty: EASY Order 3Doodler: http://the3doodler.com/store/ 3Doodler For Your School: http://the3doodler.com/education/ Follow 3Doodler on Youtube!: https://www.youtube.com/3Doodler The 3Doodler 2.0 shown in this video is currently available for pre-order and will ship on May 20th 2015. Be sure to get some plastic filaments as well, I'd recommend ABS plastic for beginners. They also work with schools so you can ask your teacher to get in touch about ordering 3Doodler for art, science or technology class! A review of my first time using 3Doodler 2.0: The 3Doodler 2.0 has a great design and is much easier to hold and use than the first version. You just need to plug it in and it heats up in 1 minute (that's less time than my GHD hair straightener :P)! Though once the plastic started coming out, it was trickier than I imagined...picture a combination between a hot glue gun and royal icing a cookie. My first 3Doodles were all weird squiggles and blobs, so don't get discouraged if your attempts don't look like the pictures on their website. I think it's most comparable to learning how to draw an image using a permanent marker in one attempt. You would not expect to be able to do that on your first try, but it's definitely a skill you can pick up with a few hours of practise. To get over the learning curve, simply experiment with the speed settings, doodling surface and changing colours.  One challenge I had was getting the ABS to stick to the card surface, and I found that using sellotape (some users also prefer duct tape) helped a bit. The plastic melts the surface of the tape very slightly which helps hold it down. The 3Doodler 2.0 comes with a nozzle remover, cleaning tool and some other useful parts. However I found small pliers incredibly useful for clearing or removing the nozzle. If you make charms or jewellery then you should already have those at home. The melted plastic did give off a slight smell but it didn't both me that much (it was like getting used to the smell of polish when painting your nails). The smell goes away if you open a window or balcony door nearby.

I printed it in 3 separate pieces to make painting and assembly a breeze. I used a few nuts/bolts to weigh down the inside of the ball so you can set it flat on a smooth surface and have it sit upright. The ball turned out better then I had expected. I printed the ball at .2mm which is less then half of the capable resolution of the printer and it still turned out amazing. The print time was right around an hour total and then all I did was lightly sand the parts, prime them with a good plastic bonding primer and then I used Krylon Fusion paint to color the segments. The last step was to apply an acrylic clear coat to the item to harden the surface and protect the paint. it also makes the item super shiny and almost exactly match the cartoon counterpart. The ball is held together with surface tension between the acrylic lacquer on each part. It actually stays together really well without any glue so its easy to open and put things inside of it. I printed the item at %50 it's original size because I wanted to start with a small item and see how it turned out.

This is my first print at .1mm layer height. There is a significant increase in detail compared to printing the same model at .2mm height. It takes longer, but in a print like this it is worth it. The layer ridges are still visible, but are much less evident. .2mm is fine for general printing, including things such as brackets, toys, and iPhone docks. When you have a model with fine detail, give .1mm a try I think you will like it!

Instead, it only partially surrounds it, likely enabling better airflow to control for humidity and may help prevent fungi from growing on, and eventually killing, the pupa. This cocoon very likely belongs to a moth in the family Urodidae, which is known for making this type of lattice-structured cocoon surrounding its pupa.

After a character is created on paper, it has to be designed on the computer via a 3D graphics program.  But at that point, you still need to see what it's going to look like in person, that's when the 3D printing becomes involved. In this video you'll see a short 2.5 hour timelapse of a 3D printer, printing out Food Fight, the Life Skylander from Skylanders Trap Team.  After the toy look is approved at Toys for Bob/Activision, it will then be colored digitally (which is not shown in this video).  After coloring of the 3D printed toy version, it's off to the factory for mass production! We hope you enjoy this inside look at how Toys for Bob prints their Skylanders Toys!

It was time to move away from printing solid objects and try to print moving objects. In this video I scale up a planetary gear set (transmission) that I picked up from thingiverse.com and I scaled it up to 200% to make it larger for a better demonstration. The end result after printing for 15 hours and a little cleanup is a functional hand crankable (or drill crankable) planetary gearbox. I can expand this gearbox to include as many series of planets as I want to reduce the gearing even more. Let me know if you guys enjoy the video and I will create more gear sets and do a follow-up on this! Also the video contains a cool trick I learned for easily detaching prints from the build surface which can be a complete pain so watch the whole thing!

It enables high-quality coloring of object surfaces and works with a wide range of materials, but suffers from the inability to accurately register color texture to complex surface geometries. Thus, it is hardly usable by ordinary users with customized shapes and textures. We present computational hydrographic printing, a new method that inherits the versatility of traditional hydrographic printing, while also enabling precise alignment of surface textures to possibly complex 3D surfaces. In particular, we propose the first computational model for simulating hydrographic printing pro- cess. This simulation enables us to compute a color image to feed into our hydrographic system for precise texture registration. We then build a physical hydrographic system upon off-the-shelf hardware, integrating virtual simulation, object calibration and controlled immersion. To overcome the difficulty of handling complex surfaces, we further extend our method to enable multiple immersions, each with a different object orientation, so the combined colors of individual immersions form a desired texture on the object surface. We validate the accuracy of our computational model through physical experiments, and demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our system using a variety of objects with complex surface textures."

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

The building blocks in this video are printed in PLA plastic and are compatible with genuine LEGO Blocks but they do not have the same tolerances, design or quality as authentic LEGO Blocks. The Blocks printed in this video are for my personal use only and are meant to be a demonstration of the abilities that a desktop 3D printer and nothing more. This video was already flagged once for Copyright Violations by 'Day Pitney LLP' but the strike was retracted after LEGO further reviewed the video and determined it did not violate any Copyright. Hey Nerdgasm fans today I was bored and decided to print some LEGO Compatible building blocks on my Ultimaker 3D printer since I couldn't find any of mine in the attic. I picked up the model from Wizard23 on Thingiverse and it works perfectly and is compatible with real LEGO blocks (but these are a different material and not as durable or fit together as well). In this video I print 2x2 and 4x4 blocks which are the most common blocks but the sky is the limit and you can print anything your imagination can come up with. The tolerance on the print is amazing and you don't have to use any support structure. The Ultimaker is able to span the gaps easily and accurately so you don't have to waste any plastic and you don't have to do any cleanup on the blocks once you are done printing them. All the blocks were printed at 0.1mm layer height in silver PLA material and they work amazingly well. The tolerances this printer can produce are amazing. Every day I'm happy that I decided to go with the Ultimaker as my 3D printer of choice and when I have time I plan to build a heated bed for it so I can print in ABS and some other materials.

This model is a single print with six moving parts, and is designed for Shapeways' nylon white strong & flexible material. The entire model is 3D printed (using selective laser scintering) with all of the parts in position; nothing is assembled post-production. The 1:9 gear ratio (made from two sets of gears each with a 1:3 gear ratio) makes the fan blades rotate nine times for every single rotation of the crank. The grip of the handle freely rotates as well. The test to design and 3D print an intricate model with moveable parts was successful. However, the fan itself is quite possibly the most inefficient one ever created. model page: http://www.shapeways.com/model/239479/hand_crank_fan.html Visit my shop at http://www.shapeways.com/shops/vertigopolka or my website at http://www.vertigopolka.com."
