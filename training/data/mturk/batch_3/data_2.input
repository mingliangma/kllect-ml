A) No, I don't have time to print and sell objects since the time to print is so long and tied up the printer. Contact shapeways.com and get an estimate and they can print anything at even higher resolutions and better materials Q) Why did your intro cut out to a black screen? A) I forgot to trim one of the outtro clips and it ran longs (oops). I didn't want to re-upload since YouTube literally takes hours to process the video so I put an annotation on it instead :D Q) Are you goings to paint it? A) Yes, I plan to setup my garage next month when I get back from World Maker Faire in New York to do projects like painting, dremell work, etc. Email business inquiries to Barnacules@barnnerd.com Help the channel by donating BitCoin to  1MfVZVMjfUUq8srg1d4RbgXR5e7JLw7R6P V Support me by sending BitCoin (Wallet Address) V 18Su2PV63BabMZWwYEhgXC8obK1XBVveCp V Get 10% off Kinesis Split Ergonomic Keyboards & Pedals V http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/ [use code 'Barnacules' at checkout to get 10% off]	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXsUIAdpZCw/mqdefault.jpg	jpg	https://youtu.be/GXsUIAdpZCw	577f1f0e51ac840b24cf32a5	TOP 10 3D Printed Creations	youtube.com	**Make sure you check the description to see where the videos came from** 1st Clip: Video Clip from Envato 2nd Clip: Carbon 3D Printer!  http://carbon3d.com/ 10.

For a long time people have been asking me to use a knife in my unboxing videos because I always open boxes with whatever crap I can find laying on my desk that has an edge of some kind. Finally one of my subscribers named John Alves decided to 3D model a custom knife for me with my @Barnacules twitter embossed into the blade! I decided to use a new material I've never used before from http://inventables.com called ABS which is the same material that LEGO and many other products are made from. It's a very durable and flexible plastic that has a higher melting point then PLA and is better suited for applications where flexibility is required. After printing the knife I think it would work better if it was printed in a harder plastic like PLA or XT material so I might give that a try if enough people enjoy this video and request a followup. The thing that surprised me the most about this knife is that it has a vicious point on it and the point didn't wear down even after stabbing a box tons of times. The knife blade also doesn't snap off and bend that much when stabbing. I honestly believe you could actually hunt and kill something with this knife! I hope you guys enjoy the video, I had a lot of fun shooting this one since it was a custom 3D model created specifically for me and that makes this video very unique. I also was very happy with the end result of printing this knife on the Robo 3D printer with the E3D hot end upgrade and all of my other tweaks I did (see my Robo 3D Tips and Fixes video). Printed @ 50mm/sec speed on Robo 3D Printer at 0.1mm layer height in 1.75mm Black ABS with 50% infill. This was my first print ever using ABS material and I really like it except for the toxic fumes it gives off. Make sure you run your 3D printer outside or in your garage if you print in ABS just to avoid getting a headache!

Today I'm doing something brand new I've never done before. I am using my Robo 3D printer to actually print something in Wood. I didn't even think this was possible a few weeks ago but someone genius figured out how to make wood Filament by mixing wood and PLA and the results are fantastic. It looks like wood, smells like wood, feels like wood but does not taste like wood! :P Music during print: Crashed by Stereofloat Printer Settings: 50mm/sec 70c bed 210c hot end 0.2mm layer height 100% infill Prep after print: Light sanding to remove blob and lip at base (sands just like wood!) I hope you guys enjoy this video where I print a round box with sliding top that can be used to store memory card or pills, etc in 30% wood. The results are amazing and it even looks like it was carved out of plywood. I am going to attempt to stain it when I have some time since the wood does appear to be porous just like real wood and seem to absorb moisture. I'm really impressed with this material and I'm looking forward to using it in many future prints! This show is an independent production of Jerry Berg (aka Barnacules).

I just reconfigured my entire Nerd Cave bedroom to setup all 6 of my consoles (XBOX 360, XBOX One, PS3, PS4, WiiU & Ouya) and I had a boatload of controllers laying around. I decided to pick up this awesome controller cradle from Thingiverse and print out 4 of them to start with and install them in my room. They work absolutely perfectly and the arms are completely replaceable which makes this one epic good design. 3D printers are the most amazing technology you can own. I have two of them now and I can literally use them to solve just about any problem in my house. I'm slowing getting into the CAD design aspect so I can make my own models from scratch but for now there is a huge amount of models on the internet that you can download, modify and print! This holder can be mounted on drywall using anchors or directly into wood on cabinets, book shelves, etc. You could even double stick tape it or Velcro it if you don't want to damage the surface of what you're attaching too.

All 4 controller hangers were printed at 0.2 layer height at 100 - 150mm/sec with Black PLA at 220 degrees. Every print came out perfect and I could repeat the print very easily. This is an amazing design because it's simple, very effective, modular and designed in a way that makes 3D printing with additive printers very easy since their are no over hangs!

Norm visits Sean while in New York to check out a beautiful 3D printed lightsaber hilt that was assembled from 14 individually printed pieces. The designer of this model also created a four-piece kit for ease of assembly--all the files are available online. With some proper finishing work, it looks as good as the original prop!
