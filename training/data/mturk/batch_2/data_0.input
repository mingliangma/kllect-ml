Baskin-Robbins, KFC, and Domino's were the only additional fast-food chains that failed to receive a ""good"" rating. Burger King and KFC were not immediately available to comment. When asked to comment, Terri Hickey, a McDonald's spokeswoman, responded: We are committed to building a better McDonald's. Our turnaround plan involves a number of changes we know our customers value. We are offering all day breakfast, simplifying our menu, making changes to the ingredients we use in our food, modernizing our restaurants and more. We are on our journey to deliver on what matters most to our customers -- and we know that is working as it has produced positive results. We look forward to continuing our positive momentum. Domino's spokesman Tim McIntyre said: We're the only restaurant chain of our size in the U.S. that has experienced seven consecutive years of positive same store sales growth and we've been rated the best-tasting pizza by independent research of all the national brands. We believe those mean something. When asked to comment Baskin-Robbins said: At Baskin-Robbins, we work hard every day to offer our guests a friendly, welcoming restaurant experience and a delicious and creative range of ice cream flavors, ice cream cakes, frozen beverages, ice cream sundaes and other frozen treats. We love taking our guests on a flavor journey when they visit our shops, offering free pink spoon samples of any of our ice cream flavors so they can try something new. We'll continue to look for ways to further surprise and delight our guests, both through new products and enhancements to the in-store experience.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"574842a2d48d087ffbde261a"	"OBAMA: Trump's proposals are aimed at getting 'tweets and headlines' rather than keeping America safe"	"BusinessInsider"	"In a trip to Ise City, Japan, President Obama gave a striking critique of Donald Trump and his proposals.

Hughes uses a style he created called ""reverspective,"" painting uncanny optical illusions of a rooms with an eerie sense of depth. The trick is that the parts of the paining that look like they should be the farthest away from the viewer are actually painted on the parts that are the closest, jutting out from the wall. This creates a truly trippy effect, and the rooms in Hughes' paintings seem to recede into the wall and follow your movement.  Hughes first came up with the technique in the 1960s, but really started making ""reverspective"" paintings in earnest in the 1980s. He's still going strong today.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5748e909d48d080ae2dfea6c"	"9 things you didn't know about Air Force One"	"BusinessInsider"	"Air Force One is the most prestigious aircraft in the US, and is charged with safely carrying the president around the country and the world (at a significant cost).

""I think we are in a cultural crisis in every field, in every industry,"" Witherspoon told the crowded room at Carnegie Hall. ""Women are underrepresented and underpaid in leadership positions."" She continued by citing hard facts. ""Under 5% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women. Only 19% of Congress is women,"" she said. ""No wonder we don't have the healthcare we deserve. Or paid family leave. Or public access to early childhood education. And that really worries me."" She then urged the audience to ask themselves ""what do we do now?"" One thing is certain though, she believes there's nothing wrong with being ambitious and asking for more.  ""I believe ambition is not a dirty word. It's just believing in yourself and your abilities,"" Witherspoon concluded. To try and help alleviate this issue in the film industry, Witherspoon launched her own production company, called Pacific Standard Films, which is devoted to finding better roles for women.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"574d9db6d48d08489afc76d4"	"Here's a killer workout you can do at home"	"BusinessInsider"	"Here is a killer at home workout that will test your muscle endurance and burn calories.

The resulting controversy spread like wildfire across the Internet. FanDuel and competitor DraftKings released a joint statement saying that ""there is no evidence that any employee or company has violated these rules."" On Thursday, we caught up with FanDuel cofounder and chief product officer Tom Griffiths. ""The recent allegations, when you go to the facts, there was no wrongdoing -- that has clearly come out,"" Griffiths tells Tech Insider. The stakes are high. DFS is projected to bring in $2.6 billion in entry fees in 2015 and over $14 billion in 2020. This week, US Senate Minority leader Harry Reid said that ""absolutely scandalous conduct"" has been happening in fantasy sports. And a fantasy football player is reportedly suing FanDuel and DraftKings over the whole affair.  When asked about possible government regulation of daily fantasy sports, Griffiths tells Tech Insider, ""We don't know of any real efforts to regulate"" from Capitol Hill. He says that FanDuel ""has always taken a conservative approach"" about the games that the platform offers, making sure to ""fit into the legal framework that exists for fantasy sports,"" citing the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. That law made it illegal to play ""games of luck"" online but allows ""games of skill"" -- like DFS, which is intensely skill based -- to continue operating.  One of the other big issues that came out with the scandal is the question of trust, given the billions of dollars that are flowing through DFS operators. Griffiths says trust is FanDuel's ""top priority"" and that it's ""crucial"" to the company's and industry's success.  ""But we recognize that there's a bigger issue here around ensuring that our players feel we can be trusted,"" he continues, ""so we are initiating a number of activities to deal with that -- as of this week, banning our employees permanently from playing on any of the sites, we're also instigating an independent partner in an investigation to ensure that we have all of the practices that we need in place to earn and build the trust of our users.""  FanDuel has received a lot of support from players and investors, he says. ""As a startup, we're no stranger to bumps in the road,"" he says. ""We've over the years had to deal with a number of things as any startup does, so the team we've built up here is resilient and getting on with their day jobs.""

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"57521a29d48d0808ad052ed5"	"Here's how to change Siri's voice"	"BusinessInsider"	"It's easy to change Siri's voice from American to British, Australian, or even male.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5752d5a4d48d0812301f1d92"	"These boxing Pakistani girls are fighting to be treated the same as the boys"	"BusinessInsider"	"The Pakistani government supported a female boxing event for the first time, according to local media reports.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"5758a15cd48d080e2fde82c6"	"The glory days of the 747 -- which is now officially on life support"	"BusinessInsider"	"The Boeing 747, which ruled the skies for over 40 years, seems like it's living out its last days.

Saunter up to the juice bar and crush a protein shake, right? You may want to reconsider. Samantha Heller, registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, and host of SiriusXM's Doctor Radio, breaks down the best times to reach for the protein and discusses the popular brand Muscle Milk. When asked for comment, CytoSport, the maker of Muscle Milk, responded with the following: When she refers to 310 calories and 32 grams protein, she is referencing the serving size we recommend for ""individuals looking to build size and gain muscle mass."" We recommend a serving size that provides 150 calories and 16 grams of protein for those wanting ""fewer calories."" The particular smoothie she mentions that includes 6 oz non-fat Greek yogurt, medium banana, 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed would provide 310 calories, 20 grams protein, 52 grams carbohydrate (with 37 grams sugar). Examples of activities that consume approximately 300 calories for a 160 lb individual: 1 hour leisurely biking; 1 hour of resistance training; 1/2 hour of running moderately (5 mph); 45 minutes swimming laps leisurely; and 1 hour walking (3.5mph). Muscle Milk products are designed to provide high quality milk protein in a form that is great tasting and convenient and without a lot of sugar or carbs (that is why we use artificial sweeteners) for active individuals. Acesulfame Potassium is an artificial sweetener that is 200 times sweeter than sugar so a little provides great sweetness without adding calories/carbohydrates (this is the benefit of artificial sweeteners -- also called ""low calorie sweeteners""). Acesulfame potassium was approved by FDA in 1988 (so has been in use for more than 25 years); approved by Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the United Nations, World Health Organization and European Union's Scientific Community on Food. We know some people want to avoid artificial sweeteners so we make products for them - Muscle Milk Organic and Muscle Milk Naturals (both sweetened with cane sugar and stevia extract).""

"BusinessInsider"	"When you buy a home, a lot of the money you spend isn't going toward your home equity. The cost of homeownership includes the money you spend on fees, taxes, and interest. These costs do not increase the value of your home nor do they reduce the principal on your mortgage. We did some analysis on the cost of homeownership versus the cost of renting. Rental costs are offset by the interest you make on the cash you did not have to put toward a down payment. Homeownership costs are offset by the tax deduction you get on your mortgage interest payments. The cost of owning a home will typically exceed the cost of renting when the price-to-rent ratio (the cost of buying a home divided by the annual rent of similar property) is greater than 20. We used data provided by Zillow for this analysis. There are numerous other factors that should be considered when deciding whether to rent or buy a home. But start by figuring out whether the cost of owning is relatively cheap or expensive based on your specific needs. Produced by Sara Silverstein and Sam Rega.

But it turns out a lot of scientific studies are actually funded by breakfast food companies.  When asked to comment Quaker said: As the trusted leader in oats for nearly 140 years, we believe it is our responsibility to invest in research around the science of oats, including their value as part of a nutritious breakfast. We believe research has only scratched the surface when it comes to this unique grain and all it can do. As such, the Quaker Oats Center of Excellence was developed to further explore the relevance and benefits of oats through science, agricultural sustainability and innovation. The Center is part of Quaker's commitment to uncover the power of the oat to provide families with the healthy fuel they want to help them do more of what matters. New information feeds innovation for future oat-based solutions intended to help people around the globe optimize their health and pursue well-being. We will continue using research to better understand both the physiological value of this meal, along with the role oats play in one's diet. That said, our commitment to the validity, integrity, and transparency of our research is something we take very seriously. Studies funded by the Quaker Oats Center of Excellence adhere to rigorous scientific procedures and standards, are conducted by independent researchers, examined by peer-reviewers prior to publication and published in reputable scientific journals. We are also committed to accurate news reporting of funded research. When shared with news media, details of studies include methodology, results and financial disclosures, with study authors also made available for commentary. We are proud of our commitment to accurate, independent research and the results that we - and many others like us - have found to help enable peoples' ability to make informed choices about what they eat.  Dr. Mitch Kanter, Executive Director of the Egg Nutrition Center said: Understanding the role of eggs in the health and wellness of Americans is important to America's egg farmers. That is why, through the American Egg Board, farmers fund the Egg Nutrition Center (ENC). The team at the Egg Nutrition Center are experienced, credentialed Ph.D.s and registered dietitian nutritionists who work with respected researchers from top universities in a credible and transparent manner, following the ILSI North America Conflict of Interest Guiding Principles, which we prominently exhibit on our website. Under these principles, the control of both study design and the research itself remain with the scientific investigators, not with ENC. In addition, each proposal is thoroughly reviewed by an external panel of experts prior to initiation of the study to ensure scientific rigor of the study design. Written agreements specify that the investigative team has the freedom and obligation to submit their research for publication to a peer-reviewed journal, regardless of the outcome. Compensation is never linked to the outcome of a research project. Once ENC-funded research is published in peer reviewed journals, ENC encourages readers to review both the findings and the methodology and judge for themselves. Additionally, we require health professionals to fully disclose ENC funding for all education efforts. Kris Charles, a Kellogg Company spokesperson said: We frequently work with external experts, academic researchers and consultants to help us further our knowledge of important issues in nutrition.  When we work with public entities, i.e., universities, they retain the decision to publish this work.  If the researcher decides to publish, the analysis and interpretation of results is the responsibility of the authors and also peer reviewers. Produced by Emma Fierberg.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5759ac7ad48d0826bc98291c"	"2 simple shopping tricks the wealthy use to save money"	"BusinessInsider"	"Economists estimate that the poor generally pay more for transportation, food, healthcare, and housing.

BUONAMICI via Getty Images Sorry, University of New South Wales: Your efforts at shattering the efficiency record for solar cells earlier this month have been, ahem, eclipsed. A group of researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a way to possibly break the maximum efficiency of a solar cell, the Shockley-Queisser Limit. The Shockley-Queisser tops off at around 32 percent, but that's taking standard solar cell setups into account. The MIT scientists switched it up and converted incoming sunlight to heat prior to having it generate electricity, a trick that could possibly double the power produced by a given panel. These solar thermophotovoltaics (above) take light and pass it through an intermediary part comprised of nanophotonic crystals that outputs thermal radiation -- something that's otherwise wasted using typical means. From there, the radiation is converted to the best-possible light wavelengths, via an optical filter, that a normal solar cell can use. The school says this method means that in the future, passing clouds or even total darkness (if a thermal storage system is in place) wouldn't affect the system's ability to gather and produce solar energy, respectively. And this is all with what the team refers to as ""unoptimized geometry."" Meaning, efficiency could go even higher than what was achieved during this experiment. Your day in the sun is over, UNSW."

Sure it's been done before, many times, but the Hyper Light Drifter Collector's Edition looks pretty sweet. It comes with a cyan ""SNES cartridge,"" a 24-page manual, a 24-inch by 18-inch world map poster, a box to store it all in and a digital code for the game. That manual is particularly welcome; a full-color booklet with information on enemies, drifters, and tons of beautiful artwork. The SNES cartridge is in quotes because it's just a non-functional piece of art. Also it's a North American-style SNES cartridge, so if you owned a European or Asian console, it won't look very familiar to you. As for the game... Hyper Light Drifter is really good. A lot of people have compared it to Dark Souls, but it's only similar in that it's difficult. It's a top-down 2D action game, with a mysterious but gentle storyline and some very tough combat. When you die -- and you'll do so a lot -- though, you just get transported to the beginning of the combat area with no punishment. In that way, it's got the ""live, die repeat"" mechanics of other indie games like Hotline Miami. Pre-orders for the Collector's Edition start today in PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One flavors, all priced at $65. If you order the PC version, you'll get a Steam code immediately, and the cool collector-y stuff late this summer. As the Xbox and PS4 versions aren't due out until summer, you'll get your code as soon as it's available. iam8bit, the store selling the special edition, says its goal is ""to have the boxes shipped out in concert with Hyper Light Drifter's console release."" In addition to the Collector's Edition, iam8bit is also selling a 4LP vinyl soundtrack and some fine art prints from the game."

Augmented and non-augmented individuals are forced to live separately, fuelling civil unrest. It's a gripping backdrop for a video game, and one you can now absorb through a new live-action trailer. Live-action video game trailers are normally a bit rubbish, but this one is surprisingly effective. You get a good sense of how the technology has developed, why so many people have embraced it, and a hint of the ""madness"" that gripped people during the pivotal ""aug incident."" Whether you're a longtime Deus Ex fan or a franchise beginner, it's enough to give you the gist of hero Adam Jensen's situation.

The project racked up $1.5 million during a Kickstarter campaign in 2013, but it wasn't enough to get the project off the ground. While they won't be getting a photo of themselves from space, the 17,000-plus backers will at least be getting their money back. The project was supposed to use a specially modified Arkyd 100 telescope mounted with a second camera pointed at an external screen that would display a user's picture and snap an extraterrestrial selfie. The company even promised users they could point the telescope at the backdrop of their choice (as long as it wasn't the sun) and a majority of the project's backers paid $25 for space selfie option. Another 27 contributors shelled out $10,000 for tickets to the selfie-scope's launch, which obviously isn't happening at this point. ""It's a decision that we make with a heavy heart,"" Planetary Resources CEO Chris Lewicki told GeekWire. While the crowdsourcing campaign shot past their expectations, Lewicki says his company couldn't find the right partner to turn this into a real space mission. Although the selfie-shooting satellite was a failure to launch, Planetary Resources is still preparing to put ""a constellation of Arkyd 100 telescopes"" in orbit by the end of 2019. Those satellites are designed for thermal infrared and hyperspectral Earth photography, however, so you might still technically be in the picture, but you'll be a lot harder to spot."

Endemol Shine Studios acquired the TV rights to Mirror's Edge and is working with EA to transform it into a female-centric action series (much like the game itself). Deadline originally reported the deal and EA confirmed its existence to Engadget. ""We are excited to be working with Endemol Shine Studios to explore a potential Mirror's Edge project for television,"" an EA spokesperson said. The original Mirror's Edge hit the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008. It's a rapid-fire first-person game starring Faith, a freerunner, as she battles a dystopian government across a sleek, futuristic city. It was heralded for innovative gameplay mechanics yet criticized for not presenting a deep enough story to satisfy many couch-bound freerunners. Its long-awaited sequel, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, is due to land on Xbox One and PS4 on June 7th, and it promises to showcase a larger storyline and bigger city to explore. Endemol Shine Studios is the scripted division of Endemol Shine North America, meaning any Mirror's Edge TV show won't be a reality series (although, watching Faith freerun around the Big Brother house would be infinitely amusing). ""We clearly see Mirror's Edge as a franchise for the global TV audience,"" Endemol Shine Studios president Sharon Hall said, according to Deadline. ""It has a strong female protagonist, a wildly rabid fan base and a worldwide brand that Electronic Arts and EA DICE have done an amazing job establishing."""

Another version of The Force Awakens soundtrack is on the way as a two LP set that has 3D holograms etched onto the surface of the records. Of course, you'll need to find the proper viewing angle in order to catch a glimpse of the spinning illustrations of a TIE Fighter and the Millennium Falcon. Disney recommends that you just shine your phone's flashlight on the vinyl to reveal the animated artwork. Etched records aren't a new development, but that doesn't make them any less fun. Jack White's so-called ""Ultra LP"" that was released in 2014 featured similar etched art from Infinity Light Science's Tristan Duke. The illustrations on this new Star Wars set were also created by Duke. You'll have to wait until June 17th to nab it from Disney's Music Emporium or Amazon. When the time comes, expect to part with $50 to secure your copy.

Jared Leto's a fan and so is Jean-Michel Jarre, who sent her to live with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon. She's modeled for Diesel and composed for German theater. She's conducted magnetic resonance imaging studies on mutated HIV cells and had paintings featured in galleries in New York. She taught herself the piano at age 10. At 15, she successfully petitioned the Los Angeles courts to be home-schooled; one year later, she enrolled at the University of Maryland. Her upcoming album incorporates the synthesized sounds of actual stars, physics themes and pitch-shifting conspiracies linked to Bob Marley and Hitler. Her list of professional accomplishments puts other so-called pop culture multihyphenates to shame. She is Simonne Jones, and you will know her name. Gravity, her forthcoming EP (due out May 27th on Universal Germany) and moody first single, explores a familiar theme: the push and pull of an irresistible lover. But this being a Simonne Jones' joint, that heartache is wrapped in a blanket of industrial beats and physics-based metaphor. ""You've set me in motion / The stars are blurs around the sun / The push and pull, the force of your body / Closer you get, I'm overcome / Bound by attraction / Floating on axis / Around your atlas / You're holding me like gravity, all around."" In less skilled hands, this scientific approach to lyrical matters of the heart could've come off as ham-handed, and run the risk of alienating listeners from the song's emotional content by shoehorning it within dense concepts. Yet, it succeeds, lending to the seductive timbre of Jones' soft voice, because this is how her mind works. As her resume can attest, Jones is equal parts creative and analytical; right- and left-brained. ""The problem-solving processes around math and music are really similar in terms of pattern recognition and the type of out of the box thinking,"" says Jones, 29, speaking to me over Skype from her adopted home of Berlin. ""And for me, I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science ... and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science. It's like why are we exploring the unknown and why are we looking for patterns in the universe to make predictions and what it all means. And when you like art, thinking really hard about that, it becomes this creative process."" Image credit: Till Janz Though it's tempting to believe all pop stars-in-the-making are contrivances borne of the music industry, Jones' tendency to wax philosophical is not a calculated quirk designed to make her more marketable. Nor is her scientific knowledge base merely some gimmick she leverages for dramatic effect. In fact, it pervades her forthcoming EP. One song in particular, Spooky Action, is inspired by Einstein's theory of quantum entanglement. ""It's the most romantic idea in the whole world,"" says Jones. ""That you have two particles and they're combined on the nuclear level. And you get separated, even if it's by an entire universe. But mysteriously and instantaneously, whatever you do to one, will happen to the other. They remain connected forever. I love that idea."" Given the themes threading through her work, it's clear that Jones, whose own life has defied convention and been guided by extraordinary serendipity, is enamoured with and inspired by the greater mysteries surrounding our universe. Take, for example, the conspiracy theory Jones latched onto and, alongside producer Liam Howe, experimented with in the creation of many of Gravity's tracks: pitch shifting to 432Hz. In the Western musical scale, the note 'A' above middle 'C' is designated as 440Hz, an arbitrary standard set by the International Organization for Standardization in the mid-1950s. But that frequency, so the conspiracy theory goes, is unharmonious to the human body and environment -- and it's rumored that Hitler even used this as a means to provoke feelings of anger and aggression by playing it for crowds during his speeches. Tuning to 432Hz, however, supposedly makes for a more natural and comforting sound. Bob Marley, Beethoven and Prince are said to have dabbled with composing works tuned at 432Hz, though no concrete evidence of this exists. ""432Hz... it just feels more therapeutic and just relaxing, calm. And then that 440Hz is a little bit more tension. It doesn't ride into you like a summer wave,"" says Jones. Born in Hollywood and raised around LA, Jones, who has mostly Cherokee and Caribbean roots along with Italian, French and Irish ancestry, is an entirely self-made creature. She does not come from a musical background and, her recent Peaches tutelage excepted, owes her virtuosity to a well-trained ear and the sort of color-coded, teach yourself to play books found in the library. At age 11, Jones quickly progressed from playing very basic songs on the piano to mastering Beethoven and Chopin, writing her own compositions, and developing an appreciation for classical music along the way. As if that musical rearing wasn't prodigious enough, Jones leapfrogged past her peers in high school, successfully petitioning the courts to be homeschooled at age 15; a fast track that led to early college admission at the University of Maryland. It was there that she solidified her foothold in the worlds of art and science with a double major in biomedical research and visual arts and a double minor in biology and art history. That education led to a brief stint at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a biomedical engineering lab based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. But as with most of Jones' career twists and turns, fate intervened to indulge her artistic leanings: In 2012, having left Baltimore to pursue music in LA, Jones got a call from Peaches asking her to sub for a tech that had fallen ill. Soon after, she found herself touring Europe and trading LA's celebrity-adjacent glitz for Berlin's hipsterized Bohemia. ""I like to say that she threw me in a sack and kidnapped me and brought me to Berlin,"" says Jones. ""She's been like a really influential mentor keeping me from signing bad contracts."" Image credit: Yamaha Synths More than that, Jones credits Peaches for encouraging her to ditch modeling, which she'd undertaken on and off since the age of 16, and pursue music production. ""She kind of locked me in her studio and made me make beats and play on her analog synthesizers and get on her drum machines."" With Peaches as her guardian angel and Berlin's DIY music scene as her backdrop, Jones began merging her creative inclinations with that of technology and science, eventually securing an artist residency at Platoon Kunsthalle. ""I'm really scientific about the way that I write songs. And then I'm really artistic about my approach to science and just understanding the philosophical concepts behind science."" Simonne Jones ""I had no idea how to do this when I started,"" says Jones. ""But I'm like, okay, I'm a really good researcher and I'm going to figure this out. Everything is on the internet. ... Then it just exploded into this thing where I built midi controllers and synthesizers, and on / off switches. ... And then really building complex loop machines that were highly customized. And then I did this art installation in Berlin that was about different topics in physics and creating a little painting LED universe about the Big Bang all the way to thermodynamic laws. And then it just became this explosion of I guess just who I am -- this mashup of both worlds."" A stint modeling and performing at a Diesel runway show led to more gigs at various fashion events and art galleries, all of which culminated in Jones landing the cover of Germany's feminist-focused Missy Magazine. It was an achievement that, while it opened the door to many new opportunities, baffled Jones considering she hadn't released any music. ""You couldn't even find a song of mine on Spotify, or Soundcloud or iTunes, or anything like that. So it kind of like was the running joke: You haven't released any material and you're boring,"" she says of that early press attention. Image credit: Robin Thomson But it was precisely thanks to that bevy of premature coverage that Jones caught famed French composer and electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre's attention. Jarre, who at the time was partnering with UNESCO on a documentary designed to follow four artists to four different countries, had read an interview with Jones on music software production company Ableton's site, and selected her as one of the four. ""I was like, I'm going to Brazil and then talk to an indigenous tribe there. I want to go and live with them and sleep in the jungle in one of their jungle huts. And that was a really intense experience,"" she says of the Amazonian visit that saw her inducted into the Guarani tribe via a sacred music ritual. While there, Jones busied herself with recording ambient sounds, which were then turned into a ""Simonne Jones"" drum kit plug-in created by Native Instruments. Her musical meanderings -- which included a job composing music for the play Jedermann (Everyman in English) at the Thalia theatre and a gig opening for the Italian leg of Thirty Seconds to Mars' tour (better known as Jared Leto's band) -- eventually snagged her a recording contract with Universal Germany. She's since recorded with a wishlist of producers who've worked with the likes of Madonna, Adele, Florence Welch, RuPaul, Lana del Rey, Esthero, Kelis and Bat for Lashes. Image credit: Platoon Kunsthalle Of that bunch of producers, Jones seems to have formed a close bond with Howe, better known as one of the founding members of mid-90s trip hop band Sneaker Pimps. It was Howe who alerted Jones to the existence of recorded star frequencies, carried out by an observatory in Paris, and suggested she use them in the production of her debut album. After Howe successfully obtained the samples from a UK-based researcher, Jones began experimenting with these cosmic sounds. She describes the net effect as ""pads that are barely visible and very subliminal underneath the tracks, but definitely add this layer of atmosphere that's really spooky and kind of weird."" ""They sound like if a star could hum,"" she says. Ultimately, listeners will have to decide for themselves whether that celestial presence, in combination with the 432Hz frequency change, has any subtle effect on how positively they perceive the music on Jones' EP. But, regardless, it's further evidence of how she's striving to unite the seemingly disparate worlds of art and science that intermingle within her, rather than merely crafting an earworm song of the summer pop hook we'll be glad to forget come fall."

That's not to say the game itself isn't any good -- in fact, it's a wonderful single- and multiplayer experience for the fantastical first-person-shooter crowd. However, the opening video is divine. It's evocative, rich and effortlessly cool, built on a base of smooth hip hop and anime-inspired, neon-coated illustrations. When I think of Battleborn, my mind is immediately saturated in the cinematic's soulful rhythm. This is a new brand of video game artistry. As a game, Battleborn doesn't feature cartoon characters; it's a fully realized 3D experience from Gearbox, the creators of Borderlands. In the same vein as Borderlands, Battleborn is highly stylized, but it looks nothing like the opening cinematic. That was on purpose. Gallery: Making the 'Battleborn' cinematic | 25 Photos 25 +21  ""I wanted to come with something fresh in a sea of CG cinematics and openers,"" Gearbox art director Scott Kester says. ""We just figured players would appreciate something a bit different. I wanted a vibe to it that was fresh, but also kind of piggybacked off the feel of Samurai Champloo's opening, with a healthy mix of Aeon Flux for good measure."" Kester was inspired by cartoons from the '80s and early '90s, and he wanted the prologue to get players pumped for the actual game. He secured the cinematic of his dreams by working with animation studio Secret Sauce and hip hop group Deltron 3030, which includes Dan the Automator (Daniel Nakamura) and Del The Funky Homosapien (Teren Jones). The cinematic's energetic animations and its mellow soundtrack balance each other perfectly; they feel as if they were produced by the same mind. In reality, they were completely separate projects. Secret Sauce CEO Sanford Greene and animation director LD Walker didn't even hear the song until their work on the animation was finished, Greene says. ""During the production of the animation we didn't have any soundtrack to go by so LD did his best to keep the shot pacing tight in the middle and open on the ends,"" he says. ""Seems it just magically worked out after Del's track was recorded and laid down."" As he wrote the lyrics for ""Countdown,"" the prologue song, Del took inspiration from Battleborn's storyline, interpreting its main points in his own way. He didn't want the track to feel like an advertisement for the game. ""I just took the subject matter of the game and I went with that, but without directly following it note for note,"" Del says. ""Tried to make it more universal in feel so it could stand outside of the game as well."" One reason these pieces came together so seamlessly was the creators' shared love of video games. Walker in particular is a fan of action role-playing titles, platformers, fighters and shoot-em-ups. Del is a huge gaming fan and he's been making music for the industry since 2000. His work has appeared in Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, a handful of Tony Hawk titles, NBA 2K5 and 2K7, Skate 3, and, more recently, Street Fighter V. ""I was a crazy player when it was the vidiot era -- '80s, you know, arcades and stuff,"" Del says. ""I used to be stuck at the arcade, I used to buy every mag.... I had every system, still have emulators of most of the classic systems with every game, I got every arcade emu for every game I ever played in the arcade -- so, uh, yeah, I'm kinda a video game fan, a little."" It also helped that Secret Sauce and Gearbox go way back. Sanford and Kester have known each other for a long time; they actually started out working together in the comics industry. Secret Sauce is a small and relatively new team, but Kester says he respects their work. Plus, working with Deltron 3030 was ""a dream"" of Kester's, partially because he's a fan of Dan the Automator and Del, and partially because this project gave him a chance to amplify their voices. Sure, Del has created music for video games, but that doesn't mean he's a household name in the gaming universe. ""Del tells such vivid sci-fi stories in his lyrics and was just a perfect fit for us,"" Kester says. ""I was specifically interested in Deltron and Secret Sauce due to the fact they aren't super widely known in the game community. I think any time you can draw more attention to different artists across different disciplines is, well, like a duty we have as creators, honestly. To expose people to new cool things."" Secret Sauce was definitely on-board with Kester's preferred animation style, too: a Japanese-inspired, anime look. ""They avoid correcting every single drawing to look perfectly homogeneous,"" Walker says. ""Instead, they let that animator cut loose and belt out the equivalent of a guitar solo."" That's what Kester wanted with the Battleborn introduction video; something raw yet intriguing to long-time FPS fans. Something different. The AAA industry is largely focused on creating realistic 3D animations, Kester notes, and he hopes the cinematic is part of video games' growth as an artistic medium. He'd love to play an entire game that looks like the prologue, for instance. ""I'm interested in seeing game art styles evolve and take us to new places visually,"" Kester says. ""We have an obsession in the gaming world to keep trying to replicate reality, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm more interested personally in making things that let me escape this world. Let's show people styles and places I could never visit in real life."" Video games are art and experiences like the Battleborn prologue help demonstrate this aspect to the wider world. Del, for his part, has always viewed games as artistic expressions. ""Maybe people just didn't believe or see it, but I did,"" Del says. ""Matter of fact, the earlier games had to have art invested in it because the graphics weren't that great."" Today, the potential for wild artistic experimentation exists within gaming, Del says, but large studios are mostly focused on creating lifelike worlds. ""I lean toward more fanciful-type games, personally,"" he says. Now that Secret Sauce has dipped its toes into the world of gaming animation, Walker and Greene are hungry for more -- and they're not just dreaming any longer. Or, as Greene puts it: ""We have plans. Let's just say that."""

Following a less-than-successful initial test run, NASA and Bigelow Aerospace have successfully inflated the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module attached to the International Space Station. It took several hours (the team didn't want any movement that could destabilize the station), but the experimental pod now extends nearly 5.6 feet out and 10.6 feet across. That's not the full size (it'll ultimately be 7 feet long), but it's hopefully smooth sailing from here on out. You'll have to wait a while before anyone steps inside this cocoon-like pod, mind you. The next objective is to pressurize the habitat, and it'll be roughly a week before the ISS crew gets to try it out. Still, this is a big step toward more livable spacecraft that use inflatable habitats to offer some much-needed breathing room.

Intrepid fan TomButcher has noticed that at least one tune in the soundtrack, ""Cyberdemon,"" shows both pentagrams and the number 666 when you visualize the music's frequencies through a spectrogram. Composer Mick Gordon recently teased that this hidden sinister imagery might be present in a video (below at the 3:29 mark), but there's no doubt about it now. Clearly, he remembers the days when the original Doom's hellish artwork had some parents in a frenzy. Music aficionados will be quick to note that stealthy image insertion isn't new. Aphex Twin (aka Richard James) legendarily inserted his own face into the spectrogram for a track on his Windowlicker EP, for a start. All the same, it's good to know that the art of sneaking in subtle audio references is far from dead -- even if you're unlikely to see this feat in many other games going forward."

""Our ambition is to enable robotic computing for every household,"" he said before revealing ZenBo the home robot. With the goals of ""assistance, entertainment and companionship,"" it's particularly aimed at older people. However, the most interesting feature here is the promise that the robot will connect with traditional and smart home devices: you'll be able to check who's at the door from a connected camera, and then remote-unlock the door from the robot's, er, face. Zenbo will be able to connect to lights, TVs, air conditioners -- if it talks the right languages. Gallery: ASUS Zenbo home robot announcement | 24 Photos 24 +20  The robot can roam around independently, and take directions by voice command. ZenBo's face also acts as a touchpad interface: you'll be able to place video calls, shop online, as well as stream video content, when it's not blushing. It's still early days, but ASUS says ZenBo will offer spoken reminders to its owners, like doctor appointment and medication cues. It'll also be able to send emergency messages to family members if someone falls down -- you can even take control of the robot and check the situation from ZenBo's built in camera. For kids, the robot will be able to (awkwardly, robotically) dance along to music as well as read stories aloud from its built-in library. Naturally, ASUS is promoting a Zenbo developer program, with access to the bot's SDK and more information to help birth apps -- something very important if the robot is to be a success. It will be inevitably compared to Softbank's Pepper home robot, and there's a few similarities, but if it can learn one major lesson from its taller Japanese rival, it's that it needs a reason to exist, a reason to buy. It could be those smart home tricks that make or break Zenbo. Although that $599 price tag is pretty cheap for a home robot -- that will certainly help."

Daniel Perdomo and crew have built a real-world Pong machine that replicates the pioneering game with physical parts. Despite what it looks like, it's not just an Atari-themed air hockey table. Instead of letting physics take over, the machine maps virtual ball and paddle movements to objects. All the eccentricities of Pong gameplay are intact, just in a more tangible (and arguably, far more immersive) form. LEDs track the score, while the controllers are rejiggered hard drives. Perdomo doesn't just want this to be a one-off project. He's hoping to find a hardware manufacturer to produce further tables.

Gizmodo notes that you can also get a first-hand look if you point a telescope to the right of the bright star Antares. It's important to remember that ""close"" is a relative term here. Earth and Mars will still be 46.8 million miles apart, so you aren't about to spot the details of Olympus Mons with your naked eyes.

Well that might be where the Eye-Plug comes in. Hidden inside a humble stand deep within Computex here in Taipei, the USB-C accessory plugs into your (currently Android-only) smartphone, adding another camera sensor to your phone for front- and rear-facing dual camera frivolity. (That's where you need that handy reversible connection.) I tested out the prototype accessory, with full production scheduled for later this year. 3D selfie videos could be a horrifying reality. The company's spokesperson told us it would be priced at around $35, which sounds insanely cheap -- we're double checking that. The company alsowasn't specifying the resolution of the camera, but the live preview footage we recorded and tested was a perfectly acceptable resolution for Google Cardboard 3D viewing. Alongside shooting your own 3D video, you can also do some post-processing focus and blurring, with the second camera helping to define depth. There's some caveats: there's no iPhone model (it's in the works), your Android phone needs a USB-C port, and the camera quality may not perfectly match your smartphone's own shooter -- not all sensors are made equal -- so color accuracy could be wobbly. The accessory pairs with custom-made camera and 3D viewing apps, and don't worry if your smartphone's camera isn't center-aligned: the software compensates and calibrates when you use the Eye-Plug, to keep things as 3D-ish as possible."

The suspension occurred thanks to an application for a license to process payments in the country being denied. Why? Because a recently passed law (PDF) in Turkey demands that a firm's IT systems be localized to the country itself if the company wants to do business there. PayPal tells TechCrunch that: ""We respect Turkey's desire to have information technology infrastructure deployed within its borders, however, PayPal utilizes a global payments platform that operates across more than 200 markets, rather than maintaining local payments platforms with dedicated technology infrastructure in any single country."" We've reached out to PayPal for more information and if this will affect the company's Venmo payment service as well, and will update this post should we get a response. This closure will apparently impact thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of customers. The ""new money"" the outfit bragged about in its Superbowl ad probably never saw this coming."

They might not be over yet. Duo Security says it found vulnerabilities in the update software for Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo. Some vendors were more secure than others in Duo's testing, but all of them were insecure enough that you could launch a man-in-the-middle attack and run your own code. In the worst cases, they'd send update data without any encryption or validation. Also, don't think that you're safe by springing for one of Microsoft's cleaner Signature Edition versions of these PCs. Duo says that some of these models still have vendor update software, so you might be in the same boat as someone who bought the garden variety PC. We've asked all five companies for comment, and we'll let you know what they say. However, Duo adds that the research took place between last October and this April, which suggests that some of the holes might have already been patched up. Dell already said that it would tackle the eDellroot flaw that created a minor panic last year, for example. Even if there's more fuss than necessary, though, this is a reminder that your PC's operating system is only part of the security puzzle -- you have to be mindful of third-party apps, too."

Unanimous A.I., a silicon valley startup, has built a platform that taps into the collective knowledge of a group of people to form its own opinions, preferences and surprisingly accurate predictions. The software called UNU successfully guessed last year's Oscar winners (11 out of 15 categories) and most recently predicted the winning horses in the Kentucky Derby. Now the artificial swarm intelligence is hosting its first AMA on Reddit, where it will respond to questions pertaining to the US presidential elections. Where robotic AIs are being built to emulate the human brain, UNU works with existing human intelligence instead of replicating it. The platform, which is open to public, allows a group of people to come together and converge on an answer in real time. While a swarm of seven predicted the Oscars, the Derby decision came from 20 people. For the AMA at 1 P.M. ET today, the group that will make political predictions is expected to range from 100 to 200 people. The participants will come from UNU's current user base that has already answered fantasy football and cooking queries. The decision-making process, which will be live on Youtube through the AMA, is straightforward. When the users sign in, they are presented with a question and its potential answers. The group has 60 seconds to drag a puck towards a chosen answer with a graphical magnet. While each participant can only see their own puck, the group arrives at a collective decision that best represents the intelligence of the swarm. UNU's human-based group intelligence follows the natural workings of certain insects like bees that tend to find solutions in swarms. There's a lot to learn from the hard working honey producers that thrive in togetherness, live in well-organized colonies and work in groups to find solutions for their striped community. As supporting evidence from nature, Louis Rosenberg, CEO of Unanimous A.I., points to a study that looked into the decision making tactics of honey bees. Around early summer every year, a couple of hundred bee scouts split from a hive of thousands in search of a new home. When they spot a branch in a tree or a hole in the wall with the potential to make a good nest, they bring that information back to the colony, where instead of casting buzz votes, the bees break into a ""waggle dance"" to communicate their preferences. Based on the bodily movements, the swarm reaches a decision. ""They negotiate in real time through body vibrations and converge on a solution for the whole group,"" Rosenberg tells Engadget. ""Biologists have found that bees will pick the optimal site almost 80% of the time. No individual bee can understand the question or find and evaluate the site. But when a group of bees form swarm intelligence, it functions as a brain of brains. It [operates] like a neural network."" Like the bees that swarm or birds that flock together, the artificial intelligence of UNU is based on the idea that people can be smarter together. ""Nature has shown that by allowing groups of similar organisms to function in a closed loop system they can become smarter than any single individual in that system,"" says Rosenberg. ""In fact it becomes a super-organism."" This collective intelligence gives the swarm the ability to make decisions, have opinions and even take on a unique personality. Since the system relies entirely on collective human knowledge and even instinct, it's easy to think of it as a kind of crowdsourcing platform for opinions and intelligence. But according to Rosenberg, UNU doesn't work like a poll or a survey that finds the average of the opinions in a group. Instead, it creates an artificial swarm to amplify a group's intelligence to create its own. For instance, when predicting the Derby winners, the swarm picked the first four horses accurately to win $11,000 in a grand bet called Superfecta. But individually, when asked to make the same predictions, none of the participants had more than one winning horse. ""Collectively, they make an expert,"" says Rosenberg. ""The individuals who participate in the swarm don't have the answers that the swarm does. They got one horse right on an average. But even though no single individual in that swarm came close, the swarm was right."" Experiments in predictions, like picking Derby winners or Trump's potential VP, validate the premise of UNU: The intelligence of the swarm is greater than the sum of its participants. It builds the evidence for the effectiveness of collective thinking. But it also highlights the fact that an intelligent system can be built with human knowledge at its core. ""We see swarm intelligence as a way to build systems that keep humans in the loop,"" says Rosenberg. ""Unlike AI, [where] we're creating an intelligence from scratch that we have no reason to believe will share human values or interests or even act in ways that we as humans understand. When we're building artificial neural networks we're building an alien intelligence. But with swarm intelligence, we're amplifying what's most human about us rather than replacing it. UNU inherently has human values and interests in the system."" While the human-based swarm system sounds safer than its robotic peers, its accuracy and superiority is yet to make an impact beyond the predictive format where it's currently being tested. But eventually, if the idea sticks and takes on a large number of global users, UNU could turn in to the ""super expert"" that it has the potential to be. Imagine a medical setting where a swarm of doctors accurately diagnoses a disease. ""Instead of relying on a single expert you'd have a group of experts who can collectively come up with answers that are significantly more insightful and accurate than individuals working on their own,"" says Rosenberg.  ""What we'll see is the ability to democratize expertise."""

If you want to record a cinematic tracking shot or college campus tour, you don't need any people or noisy equipment on the scene. The dolly has an attachable mount that accepts virtually any VR camera array weighing less than 5 pounds, including those built for action cameras and smartphones. It's not a trivial purchase at $3,000 for a full kit (the same as the regular telepresence robot), but that's still reasonable for pro VR productions.

Trying to buy them. All three of the company's phones have been sold, at least initially, using an often frustrating invite system. Fans could obtain one by completing various competitions, responding to social media posts or by cajoling their friends who had already bought a OnePlus phone. But no more. With the OnePlus 3, which will be launching on June 14th, the company is killing the invite system once and for all. Fans with a OnePlus VR headset will get a head start, but then it's fair game from 3pm ET on the OnePlus website. OnePlus has always argued that the invite system was necessary to control demand for its phones. Co-founder Carl Pei says it stopped the company from building too many handsets, which could have sat unsold in a warehouse somewhere. Unlike Amazon, which can easily take the loss on some unwanted Fire phones, OnePlus had to be careful with its supply chain. ""The invite system allowed us to scale our operations and manage our risks to help us grow more sustainably,"" he explains in a forum post. ""Invites are gone forever from future OnePlus product launches."" Two years later, much has changed. OnePlus is no longer a fledgling brand with few fans and zero reputation. It's delivered three, mostly excellent phones and has built a strong, loyal fanbase that crave new announcements. With the OnePlus 3, the company is finally ready to sell a phone like a conventional OEM. How that will affect its image -- and the hype associated with each product release -- remains to be seen, however."

While they may be showcases for new features, they still represent the baseline for what the platform can do. That might not last for much longer, though. CEO Sundar Pichai told guests at the Code Conference that Google will ""thoughtfully add more features"" to Android on Nexus phones going forward. The company will also be more ""opinionated"" about the design, the exec said. Third-party companies will still make the hardware, but it's evident that rumors of Google taking greater control of the Nexus program were well-founded. You can see the Nexus-related remarks below, starting at the 20:24 mark. The chat also saw Pichai tackle concerns about privacy, especially for Google Home. No, you won't have to share your voice command history with Google -- there will be an ""off the record"" mode that doesn't send your data. The CEO also mentioned hopes for tighter control over privacy as a whole. He imagined telling Google to forget the last 4 hours of search activity, as an example. On top of this, Pichai was adamant that Google ""want[s] to be in China"" and is taking a ""thoughtful"" approach to making it happen. Just what that means isn't immediately apparent, although there has been talk of Google Play and a handful of Android services coming to China. The big challenge is balancing the company's desire for profit with its historical aversion to censorship. As much as the company hates that its services aren't available on Android phones sold in China, it also doesn't like having to remove apps or search terms in the name of silencing political dissent."

Just a few months ago, the chip giant announced that it would be laying off 11,000 workers and taking a step away from the PC market. Instead, it'll be focusing on wearables and IoT devices. Coinciding with those announcements was an executive shuffle that put Navin Shenoy, its Mobile Client VP, in charge of its wider Client Computing Group (which covers all consumer devices). At Computex this week, we had a chance to pick Shenoy's brain about Intel's path forward. What do you envision being the next major breakthrough for PC form factor? We're working on lots of things that are mind-blowing. To me, we have to figure out how to get to J.A.R.V.I.S. [Iron Man's trusty AI, not Intel's vaporware earpiece]. The ability to manipulate things wherever you are, look at things wherever you are, talk to things in a more natural way. That's the next big breakthrough in computing. And it will be in so many domains, it won't just be PCs. It'll be phones, tablets and also new types of things we haven't conceived of yet. I'm a fan and believer in the notion of ambient computing... Today you have ""destination computing,"" where you go and sit down with something like an all-in-one. You have ""carry with you"" computing, like a notebook. And you have ""pocket computing,"" your phone. But really, what computing needs to evolve to is ambient computing, where it's just around you and it just sort of disappears. I don't know if it's a form factor or not. I think the form factor becomes less relevant when it's just sort of around you. How is Intel getting there? We've spent a lot of time thinking about decompressing the technology problems associated with ambient computing. There are several: there's low-power, high-performance computing that you need almost always, in whatever device you have. Not everything will happen in the cloud. There will be some form of distributed computing, where some happens in the cloud, some will happen locally, it all just depends on the particular workload being done. That's one aspect. [There's also] far-field microphone arrays, how do you optimize the mic the solution? What are the right algorithms to use? How do you apply those algorithms into either an audio DSP on the platform, or some other technology on the platform itself. How do you combine that with other devices that might sit in the home, like a home gateway? How do you optimize the WiFi connectivity between the gateway and your device? How do you do end-to-end workloads from the cloud and to the end gateway and client device? There are so many technology problems to be solved. We're going to do what we usually do, and find the ones that nobody else is solving, or that we're uniquely positioned to solve. And we'll partner with the software ecosystem that maybe does other things, like the AI engines and the actual user interface. I'm wondering how Intel will do that. These are things running on mobile processors... Where along the chain does Intel come in? Well, they won't necessarily always run on mobile processors. And today even, they don't just run on mobile processors. I think you're going to see far-field in the PC domain, in all in ones, in all sorts of things. Some of them you'll see today, some you'll see in the future. While today there are some examples that use mobile processors, like any other domain, computing is going to be this sort of spectrum. Some things that are extraordinarily form factor constrained may have mobile CPUs. And things less constrained will have higher performance CPUs. And so we'll participate wherever we can. With mobile processors, Intel has admitted it missed out. What's happening with them now? We're just really taking a much broader view, and thinking about where the world is going, not necessarily where it's been or where it is now. And if you kind of think about what we think about today, there's just a much broader way to think about connected devices. We're not thinking about a PC only. Or a phone only, or a tablet only. We really are thinking about this broad array of connected things ... and figuring out where are the optimal places for us to add value. So that being said, you will see us participating in phones in some way shape or form. Our modem technology is going to be used on many networks around the world. Even on 4G, we think we have an opportunity with our modem. We think as we go to 5G, there's going to be just a completely different way of thinking about the network. From narrowband IoT for things like a parking meter with very low bandwidth and low power, to sub-6GHz kind of things that pump very high data rates over a mobile device, to 28GHz with millimeter wave, to 39GHz to 60GHz. We already have Wi-Gi 60GHz in the market today. We just have a much broader spectrum, and a much broader way of thinking about how we can participate. Some of that will be medium to long-term. And some will be sooner. An array of devices powered by Intel's SoFIA chip. It's sad to hear about SoFIA (Intel's now defunct smartphone processor). Now you're talking about datacenters and AI. But the connection is the key there, how are you going to resolve that missing piece of the puzzle? The place where we chose to exit is in the low-end of the smartphone market, with SoFIA. Quite honestly we didn't see an opportunity to offer our customers something they thought was differentiated or different. Or on our side, we didn't think we could make sufficient money. So we're optimizing for profitability. But we're continuing to look for opportunities to do something different. When you think about the future, is the smartphone really done as a device like that, or will it continue to evolve? Of course it's going to evolve. There will be converged mobility. If you think about what we did with the 2-in-1... We said we have the PC, we have the tablet, can we converge usage in some rational fashion? The first 2-in-1s weren't the best, but over two or three years we've seen them get better and better. Could we do the same thing with something even smaller? Perhaps we could. All I'll say is we're not done experimenting and looking for opportunities to do something different. But we're going to be smart about how we do that. The modem, we think, is going to be crucial. 4G and 5G modems are going to get increasingly complex, and there's going to be fewer and fewer companies in the world that can do it. You've seen companies like Broadcom, Marvell and NVIDIA get out of the modem. We're to the point now where it's a very scarce asset, and an increasingly valuable one. Are you also actively working in the AI space? We're hearing more about it from your competitors, like Qualcomm. I'm not sure about all these buzzwords and what people even mean by AI anymore. ... Right now, to put it in perspective, machine learning is really only 1 percent of the workload today. But it's growing really fast and we're super excited about it. On the training side, and on the actual recognition side, we're doing quite a bit of work to optimize the data center solutions we have. On the device side, that's where you get into things like computer vision, cognitive computing. And there's a number of things that we're looking at, we haven't talked a lot about this. I'm sort of in the ""talk less, do more"" space. But suffice to say, there are a number of really interesting things we can think about doing with various solutions. You can imagine taking FPGA [Field Programmable Array chips, which can be reprogrammed on the fly], graphics, or CPU core technology and combining them in interesting ways. You can imagine taking things like RealSense and using it to capture the world in a different way, and do some interesting things. Stay tuned, you'll hear more from us. You mentioned FPGA, that's something that could be hugely transformative. Are there any updates in terms of what Intel plans to do with that maybe on the desktop side? I'm not the expert on FPGA. ... Most of the effort on FPGA with Altera [which Intel acquired last year] will be on the data center side, and to some extent IoT. There are some IoT applications that would take a datacenter Xeon and FPGA and will combine them to do interesting things. We're exploring in my business on the client side whether there are opportunities, but for now most of our energy and emphasis in FPGA are on IoT and datacenter. The idea of FPGA in a desktop processor is really intriguing, especially with something like Viv coming along, the AI platform which basically writes itself. Is that something you're thinking about? There's new domains that are emerging, like autonomous driving. It will utilize a lot of interesting PC technologies, a lot of interesting datacenter tech, it'll have all sorts of machine learning. The datacenter might do the learning part. But the training part, taking all the algorithms and teaching the system what all these things are, creating a big database, and then pushing that information out, [happens] on the car itself. And the car will have to recognize ""Is that a cat, or a leaf?"" and do that in real-time. So there are places where we are looking at [FPGA]. Whether that makes it into a PC or not, maybe someday it would. Is there anything close to a consumer product using Curie [Intel's tiny wearable chip] at this point? It's one of these things where we want to tap into the maker creativity. We will never be able to conceive, sitting inside of the walls of Intel, what people could do with something like Curie. We have some ideas. We think it's kind of cool to apply within sports. We think it's cool to apply to entertainment and music -- Lady Gaga integrated Curie in her Grammy performance. We're experimenting with it. But the whole reason we did the America's Maker show [a competition where inventors were tasked with using Curie in their projects] to just tap into the imagination of hundreds of thousands of makers out there. You mentioned a home gateway during the keynote, could you talk more about that? What we announced was the home gateway system-on-a-chip (SoC), combined with a MU-MIMO WiFi chip. We're offering both of those in combination in a reference design, which companies like ASUS and Arris can take to market as retail gateways. So what are those, exactly? The way to think about a gateway is, on the one hand it brings in whatever access you have to the internet. It might be fiber, it might be DSL, or it even might be a wireless 4G backhaul. We have an SoC that combines any access method, so the service providers love that. They can be agnostic, since their box can support anything. And once that signal comes into the home, the WiFi chip becomes the means by which the content can be reattributed into the home. And we can do interesting tricks where the WiFi we have on the client side on the PC can be optimized to work with the WiFi in the gateway. The gateway itself, as the OEM configures it, can be more than just a router. It can be a place where things are actually stored. It could be like a NAS [network attached storage], it can be a modem and a gateway. There's all sorts of combinations being rethought now. This is going to evolve dramatically over the next three or four years. The central datacenter sitting in Seattle or Virginia or something, will not be sufficient to redistribute content to the consumer as the world moves from full HD to 4K to 8K. Or as the world moves from normal flat content to VR. You will have to sort of take the network and redistribute it out closer to the user. And we believe that gateway can be an interesting access point into the home, where various combinations of compute will be reconfigured. More compute will move into that device, as well as more storage and networking. Things will start to get queued, where you'll do progressive downloads of various things based on user profiles. You'll have various content sort of on demand there locally in your home. All those kinds of things are going to happen over the next several years. Our vision for this thing is pretty expansive and broad if you think about it. Is this something Intel has done before? We were in the cable modem area of the home gateway. About a year ago we acquired a company called Lantiq, which brought us a number of other technologies like DSL, 4G and fiber. So now we have all the various means by which you will connect to the internet inside of a single SoC. And we basically leverage Atom for the horsepower, along with those other IPs we've acquired from Lantiq. The 10-core i7 processor is really interesting, will anything trickle down to the 7th generation Core chips, like Turbo Boost Max 3.0? We'll see. (Laughs) Turbo Boost Max is really interesting technology. Let's say you've got 10 cores running, let's find the most favored core that's running. There's a distribution curve in our manufacturing profile, so one core may run slightly faster than the others. Historically we would just say, we'll run all the cores at the frequency of the weakest link. Now we're able to, on a 10-core processor, say one core is faster than the other nine, and we can dedicate single-threaded workload to that core so you can get faster speeds. It's a really innovative idea. It tends to be more applicable to higher core count CPUs. Some of our commenters don't think it's that expensive, for what you get. (Laughs) I love those guys and gals. They're just amazing. At our Intel Extreme Masters events, you go to a sports stadium and there are professional gamers there. And there's 20,000 to 30,000 people there, watching other people play games, they're fanatics. And then online on Twitch, there's a million people watching those people watch other people play games. It's the most mind-blowing thing. All they want is the best. If we could give them a 20-core processor, they'd buy it. If we could give them something slightly higher, they'd buy it. I love people with insatiable demand for compute. Richard Lai contributed to this report.

With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics.

But, rather than be satisfied with exclusive access to the wallets of a half million tourists come August, the company is using the event to introduce a new ring that will let people pay with a wave of their hand: No phone, wallet or even battery needed. Gallery: Visa payment ring | 5 Photos 5 +1  The unnamed band is pretty simple in design. The interior contains a secure microchip from Gemalto and an embedded antenna; the exterior is simply a black or white ceramic loop. The addition of any kind of decorative metal or dye would interfere with the antenna. It also won't be custom-fitted but, with 20 sizes available during its trial run, most testers should be able to find a good match. That initial group includes employees and partners, but most notably the 45 athletes sponsored by the payment provider, including swimmer Missy Franklin and fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad. It was discussions with those Olympians that inspired the creation of the payment ring; wallets and standard wearables can be a real annoyance when you're constantly changing in and out of uniform. Decathlete Ashton Eaton specifically told Visa he wanted something he could just integrate into his daily routine and forget about. So the ring was designed not only to be inconspicuous, but also be water resistant to 50 meters and never need charging. Instead, the ring draws a tiny bit of power from the payment terminal, just enough to enable the transaction. It doesn't exchange as much data as Apple Pay or Android Pay, but it's on par with swiping your card. Visa actually provides a card with the ring, for those instances when contactless pay isn't available. Rings have an annoying tendency to go missing, but Visa prepared for that situation too. The payment band can be deactivated from a smartphone, and thieves who find one won't be able to get anything useful out of it thanks to tokenization. That means sensitive data is replaced by a digital identifier that can be used to process payments, but doesn't actually contain any personal information. At this point the ring is merely a prototype and won't be available to the general public in time for Rio. Instead, the Olympic Village will be a testing ground to find out how well it performs in the field. The band I saw in New York looked and felt great, and the first time I used it on a payment terminal felt magical. I waved my hand and heard that telltale ""beep"" of a successful transaction. But I was lucky: Subsequent attempts were hit or miss, and I was told this was a common problem thanks to the diminutive design of the wearable. The ring works best when the full 'O' of it is facing toward the terminal; if it's held at a 90-degree position above the keypad, as it would be when you hold your palm flat, the reader doesn't pick it up. I found that holding my hand at a 45-degree angle sometimes worked. Visa plans to encourage the athletes to try a different hand position -- don't be surprised if you see a few of your favorite competitors trying out a 'fist tap' next time they need to pay for a Coke in Rio."

It's all part of some very clever game design on the part of Hitman's developers, as explained in this engaging YouTube video by way of Mark Brown of Game Maker's Toolkit. In the video, Brown delves into the very thread of how this feat can be accomplished: repetition, repetition, repetition. If you've ever wondered how the game developers themselves took the seemingly impossible task of getting you into Agent 47's psyche, the video is an interesting watch.

Announced earlier this week, ASUS' Zenbo is aimed at providing ""assistance, entertainment and companionship."" Like numerous home robots that have (literally) rolled out before Zenbo, it involves voice-activated commands, cameras, an internet connection and a touchscreen. It can't wash your clothes or clear the table and you still need separate robots to vacuum your house, or get you from A to B. ASUS says Zenbo can help with cooking, but that just means it can read out recipes. It's not chopping onions for you -- it doesn't even have arms. Let's take a look at the promo video. In the world of ASUS' TV ad, WiFi connections are strong and acting skills are weak. We're shown how Zenbo can detect faces and take photos and videos through voice commands. It will also respond to questions. It gives reminders for medication or upcoming events, has built-in speakers for streaming music, and can even connect with smart home devices like air conditioners, lighting, TVs and connected door locks. And yet, smartphones and tablets can already do all of that. I have Siri on my iPhone, I can play music on it, I can use apps to control my smart devices and it even has an alarm and calendar. What differentiates the robot from your smartphone is its ability to move around either independently or through smartphone controls, like remote home monitoring. According to the company, Zenbo will learn and adapt to how you use it with with proactive artificial intelligence. As it lives alongside you, it'll get better at identifying objects and people on its cameras, as well as recognize speech commands. ASUS says machine learning and cloud computing will help improve the robot's functionality; Zenbo will be connected to a hive mind of all the other robots. It's still so very far away from the robotic butler we're still waiting for: Machines are getting smarter, but robotics are hard. There's no Rosie, no C3P0, no Kryten. Heck, there's not even a Bender. They're all still many years away. Here in the present, the world isn't as perfect as the ASUS family vignette. The on-stage debut of Zenbo (and three subsequent demonstrations I saw over this past week) showed that manipulating a robot can be just as frustrating as working with pets and children. Sometimes Zenbo didn't go where it was told, or it didn't hear the host's simple commands (despite them being repeated multiple times). On other occasions, Zenbo failed to pick up on camera gestures, or it simply stopped and did nothing. Yes, this was an early model. And yes, the company will continue to refine its behavior and sensitivity, but as it stands, it doesn't have enough pros to outweigh the cons. It's not fair to single out ASUS' Zenbo bot, although the promotional ad was particularly awful. I've already written about how we have to lower our expectations about what robots are capable of at this point in time. Indeed, the same criticism can be leveled at most home robots, some of which are already on sale. Softbank's Pepper could also be described as a glorified tablet on wheels. Its gestures and movements are adorable and endearing, but its speech recognition is far from perfect and there's still no killer app, other than the romantic notion of having a robot in your home. There are still so many technical challenges facing robots, with researchers and companies chipping away at challenges related to movement, motor control and object detection, among other things. Sci-fi films and television shows have set our expectations very high, so it's no surprise that current home robots are a bit of a letdown. ASUS' first bot is at least ""reasonably"" priced at $599, but the reasons for buying one aren't strong enough -- yet."

Those partners will be able to build AR headsets like HoloLens, full-fledged VR headsets like the HTC Vive, as well as components powering those devices. It's similar to Microsoft's original approach to PCs with Windows -- build the operating system and let others go wild with hardware -- as well as its push for new form-factors with the Surface. With the VR market still feeling like the Wild West, a bit of stability from Microsoft could be a huge help. Just as we've seen with desktops and mobile, the virtual reality market boils down to a few big platforms vying for dominance. Facebook has Oculus; Valve and HTC are betting on SteamVR for the Vive; Sony has its upcoming PlayStation VR; and Google is focusing on its DayDream platform for Android. At this point, Oculus and Sony are practically Apple-like, refined pieces of consumer hardware on platforms that nothing else can run on. Valve's SteamVR and Google's DayDream, on the other hand, are open to a variety VR headsets (you can already run some SteamVR games with an Oculus Rift). And Windows Holographic is ... well, Windows. ""Nobody has built an operating system for this generation,"" Microsoft's Terry Myerson, executive vice president of its Windows and devices group, said during a Computex press conference. That alone makes Microsoft's platform more compelling than the competition. While its partners likely won't have nearly the amount of freedom as they would with something like SteamVR, there's a certain amount of confidence in building for Windows. And until standalone Android VR headsets hit the market, Windows is the only platform that can power an AR/VR device on its own. Surprisingly, Myerson told us that a third-party company might even make a consumer HoloLens before Microsoft. ""Either way, that's fantastic,"" he said. While we've been impressed by HoloLens demos, the hardware still has some issues, particularly its very narrow field of view. If another company manages to come up with a better solution before Microsoft, that's ultimately a good thing for the entire Windows Holographic platform. At the moment, Microsoft has a decent stranglehold on VR. Both the Vive and Rift can only run on Windows, much to the chagrin of Apple fans. But it's another thing entirely to own the entire VR pipeline, so that developers can build using Windows Holographic tools and consumers will be able to have VR experiences without juggling other storefronts from Oculus and Valve. Simplicity is what virtual reality needs at the moment, and Microsoft has a good shot at making that happen. The biggest benefit of Microsoft opening up Windows Holographic? We'll see plenty more companies getting into the VR game, which will hopefully lead to more innovative products. Ultimately, it'll be far better for consumers if VR isn't something that only a handful of companies like Facebook control. Partners already onboard with Microsoft's vision include Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Acer, ASUS, Dell, Falcon Northwest, HP, Lenovo, MSI and others. There are reasons to be skeptical: Microsoft's attempt to bring Windows to the mobile world has been fraught with failure, to the point where it's basically given up on smartphones. There was no mention of mobile at the Build developer conference, and I've heard from Microsoft reps that it's just not something they're thinking about in 2016. Microsoft has also backtracked from its Nokia acquisition in major ways, after laying off nearly 10,000 employees, writing down $8.5 billion from the deal (between this year and last year), and selling off Nokia's feature phone business. The difference with VR and AR, though, is that Microsoft isn't several years late to the party. With HoloLens, it's actually ahead of the curve -- it's a product that likely won't have many consumer applications for years, and at $3,000 for the developer edition, it's more expensive than today's VR headsets. HoloLens is more comparable to Magic Leap's mysterious augmented reality technology, which still hasn't been publicly shown. Microsoft has previously said that Windows Holographic is fully VR-capable, we just haven't seen any examples of that yet. We might not have to wait long, though. At Computex, Myerson teased that it's been working closely with HTC on a consumer VR product. And during its keynote and demo videos, Microsoft showed off people wearing the HTC Vive running Windows Holographic. The idea of having VR and AR devices working on a single platform is pretty compelling. Microsoft gave us a glimpse of how it's envisioning the evolution of the HoloLens platform in the video above. It shows someone wearing a HoloLens headset collaborating with a colleague wearing an HTC Vive, and another colleague wearing HoloLens in another part of the world. Together, they were able to design a retail space virtually, almost as if they were in the same room with each other. Sure, it'll be years before that sort of collaboration is possible, but what's important now is that Microsoft is building towards that future. And hopefully, that'll mean cheaper and better access to virtual worlds for everyone. Stay on top of all the latest news from Computex 2016 right here."

However, making changes typically means waiting for the current version to finish printing and starting a new build from scratch. Researchers at Cornell University are looking for a better solution that makes for easy tweaks and they've built ""an interactive prototyping system"" to do so. The ""on-the-fly"" 3D printing setup outputs the design that's being worked on as its created in a CAD file, allowing the user to pause for testing, measurements or to change the model that's still in progress. Using a wire frame construction that looks similar to what the 3Doodler pens create, the system builds a model of the object's shape rather than a complete solid. With a ""low-fidelity sketch,"" a designer is free to make any changes before moving on to making the filled in shape. In other words, if you were working on a toy plane that would carry a Lego figure (one of the group's projects), you could print the underlying structure of the object to see if it would work rather than wasting your time and materials on an in-progress version. What if you need to remove something that's already been printed? Well, the device has a cutter that removes those pieces and the printer's base is aligned by magnets. The magnets make it removable for those tests and measurements, but ensures you put it back in the right place to resume construction. A CAD plug-in designs the wire frame version of the object and while printing can continue while changes are being made to the digital file, the system will pause when it gets to that area until any tweaks are finished. The project received support from Autodesk and the National Science Foundation, so hopefully a consumer-friendly version will become available in the future."

In addition to weapon skins and a placard for your avatar if you play for 10 hours, there's a special weapon (the Fireworks Flare Launcher) and vehicle (Mikro JC14 ""New-Cross"") in store for everyone, regardless of play-time. But how are Crackdown and APB even remotely connected? Well, in case you forgot, it's time for a bit of a video game history lesson. Developer David Jones worked at Rockstar North precursor DMA Design, and was a producer on the original Grand Theft Auto. He worked on a few Nintendo 64 games after that (Body Harvest and Space Station Silicon Valley) before returning to a life of crime with Grand Theft Auto 2. Jones founded Realtime Worlds in 2002, which was responsible for the first (and best) Crackdown, a comic-book styled open-world game that put you in the shoes of what was essentially an acrobatic superhero cop, and then the original All Points Bulletin. If you're a fan of GTA Online, know that it got a lot of its ideas from APB.Despite the game's ambition and potential, though, financial woes forced the game to shut down in 2010 after the MMO's servers had been live for just three months. It was picked up and turned into a free-to-play game by K2 Network in 2011 under the name APB: Reloaded. Now, Jones is heading up development on Crackdown 3 for Microsoft. See? Full circle."

Imagine what happens when they avoid fixing those holes in the name of a little cash. KeePass 2 developer Dominik Reichl has declined to patch a flaw in the password manager's update check as the ""indirect costs"" of the upgrade (which would encrypt web traffic) are too high -- namely, it'd lose ad revenue. Yes, the implication is that profit is more important than protecting users. The impact is potentially quite severe, too. An attacker could hijack the update process and deliver malware that would compromise your PC. To his credit, Reichl notes that he'd like to move to encryption as soon as he believes it's possible. You can also verify that you're getting a signed download, if you're worried. However, it's still contradictory to develop a security-centric app and decide that security should take a back seat. Even if it's true that ad income would take a steep hit, the consequences of knowingly exposing people to attack (including alienating those who once trusted the password tool) are likely far more severe."

Betty Boomer/US Army As you might imagine, soldiers can't just use garden variety earplugs to protect their ears. It might tone down the sounds of explosions and gunshots, but it'll also prevent them from hearing a crucial command or an enemy on the other side of a doorway. It's less of an issue for the US Army these days, though. The military branch has been gradually rolling out a smart earplug, TCAPS (Tactical Communication and Protective System), that adapts to the audio realities of war. The smartphone-linked device softens louder noises, but amplifies quieter ones; if your squad leader needs to issue a command, you'll hear it over the din of battle. It's a relatively simple system, but it's very flexible. Some versions link to a soldier's existing communications, and it'll play nicely with hearing aids. TCAPS is far from ubiquitous. Only 20,000 of the earplugs are in the field, and it's doubtful that every single person in the infantry will get one when they cost around $2,000 a pop.

PayPal has refused to refund Anthony Archer after he made a total of $50,000 in donations to several well-known Twitch users (including LegendaryLea and NoSleepTV) as part of a trolling scheme. He'd intended to cancel the transactions through PayPal a month after making them, leaving the streamers high and dry, but PayPal wasn't having any of it -- he's on the hook for the full amount. And given that he appears to have used his parents' credit card, he's in more than a little trouble with them, too. It's not as if gigantic donations are unheard of. Some streamers (including some of those targeted by Archer) have received tens of thousands of dollars in legitimate contributions from wealthy viewers. However, this serves as a reminder that there are risks to making a living from community donations. Unless you have a safety net like PayPal's, you could lose your shirt to a less-than-sincere fan."

Information about the game's release date and setting leaked prior to Ubisoft's big livestream this morning, but the reveal offered a few more details about the sequel's main character and new tricks. Watch Dogs 2 stars Marcus, a gifted hacker who hails from Oakland. He was once profiled and accused of a crime he didn't commit, which led him to work with the anti-establishment hacking group Dedsec. Marcus isn't just a hacker; he's also skilled at parkour and fighting. He favors a DIY melee weapon that's basically a billiard ball attached to a thin, strong rope. Players will be able to complete Watch Dogs 2 without killing anyone, using items like a taser to knock out foes. Ubisoft promises Watch Dogs 2 offers more control and flexibility in hacking. Players can hack every character, every vehicle and most of the electronics in the city. Later in the game, Marcus will be able to hack groups of people, too. Plus, he can drive most vehicles. Marcus has a few special hacking tools, including an RC car with an extendable arm and a quadcopter used mainly for scouting. Players can use the drone to fly over the Bay Area in a first-person view. Eventually, Marcus will get his hands on 3D-printed weapons, as well. Players in single-player mode will occasionally run into other actual, live players running around the city -- they're all members of Dedsec, meaning they're your friends. Ubisoft developers say hacking is a lifestyle and they want to respect that culture in Watch Dogs 2."

But there are times when I miss some of the benefits of being outside, like a cool breeze and changing scenery. While a gym's AC unit can never really capture the magic scent of flowers and pine as you pass through a peaceful glade, workout designer company Les Mills has come up with a way to at least restore the sense of excursion with its new program, ""The Trip."" Instead of staring at a mirror for the duration of each spin class, riders sit on bikes in front of a giant screen and are enveloped in visuals that help create the illusion of motion. You may not physically leave the studio during the half-hour spin session, but thanks to some inventive imagery, you'll mentally travel farther than a standard bike ride could ever take you. Gallery: 'The Trip' immersive spin class | 10 Photos 10 +6 The Trip made its debut in Santa Monica, California, last November and in March arrived at David Barton's new gym in Midtown Manhattan, TMPL. That puts it in competition with ImaxShift, the immersive spin class introduced by the eponymous film company in May. Both classes feature a curved screen, booming sound system and an (overly) enthusiastic instructor. When I tried ImaxShift I found some positive aspects to the experience, but the sensory overload left me overwhelmed. On the surface it would seem that the Trip might induce the same feelings, but a series of small differences make it a more uplifting experience. Though Imax is known for delivering larger-than-life cinematic experiences that can really draw you into the story and setting of your favorite films, Les Mills actually delivered a better narrative for an immersive exercise program. You start in a simulacrum of San Francisco, biking up and down the steep hills of the city until you cross the Golden Gate Bridge and enter a lush green forest. From there the scenery on the 30-foot screen gets increasingly whimsical, from a strange Wonderland-esque backdrop filled with rainbow mushrooms to a series of glossy neon-lined pathways reminiscent of Tron. Eventually you end up back where you started, gazing upon a sunset-tinged cityscape. It's no wonder this particular program is called ""The Rabbit Hole."" Each ride has a specific playlist, making it possible to explicitly tie the visuals to the beat of the music. ""The Rabbit Hole"" starts with a cover of ""Who Are You?"" by the Travellers and closes with Nas' ""The World Is Yours"" -- perhaps an indication of how you should feel when you finish the 30-minute program. It's an intense workout, requiring you to bike up steep hills for periods of between 15 and 60 seconds. Of course, these are merely virtual hills that you create by adjusting the resistance lever just below the handlebars on your cycle. The lever was a lot easier than the dials I've used on other bikes, which is just one part of why the Trip is as intuitive as it is. You see, when I tried ImaxShift I had an issue with following the instructor's directions. The music would often drown out his voice, making it impossible for me to keep up and get the full workout. The Trip has the music at a more reasonable level. But even when I couldn't hear the spin director, the screen provided plenty of visual cues as to my next action. A gentle slope? Increase the resistance slightly. A steep hill? Crank it up. Now we're going back down the hill, so lower that resistance all the way down and enjoy the glide. The computer-generated scenery wasn't even close to Academy Award-winning graphics, but the aesthetic cheesiness of it didn't really matter -- the need to react to the images I was seeing made me feel more involved. It became more immersive as a result, and I was able to imagine myself going up those hills because I felt it both physically and emotionally. As the class biked back through the forest to end up back in the city where we started, I also experienced an acute feeling of satisfaction. Sure, I was riding high on the thrill of a good workout, but there was also that completion you get out of a good narrative. And, in a way, that's what a bike ride is: It's a simple story, in which you travel some distance and eventually return where you started, a little better for the experience. And isn't exercise in its own way about making us better people? If the the Trip is a journey of self-improvement you'd like to take, the program is currently available at 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport in Santa Monica and TMPL in New York City. Unlike ImaxShift, individual spin classes aren't available for purchase; instead, you'll have to sign up for a club membership, which runs $165 a month at TMPL. This gives you access to all of the gym's facilities, not just the virtual reality studio. But why would you confine yourself to a stuffy weight room when you could be gliding through futuristic cities and sunset-lit canyons instead?"

After tackling Hitman and Tomb Raider, the studio is taking on the futuristic augmentations of Deus Ex. Unsurprisingly, it's called Deus Ex Go, and will be launching sometime this summer to coincide (roughly) with Mankind Divided, the next core entry in the franchise. It keeps the premise of the previous Go games -- simple, stylized graphics and node-based stages that you have to traverse -- but mixes up the formula with some new power-ups and enemy types. Success is dependent on understanding and manipulating every element on the board. I was able to try an early build containing the first five or six levels. Swiping around with Adam Jensen, the hero of Mankind Divided, I could pick up items that granted invisibility for a couple of spaces. A terminal allowed me to disable a turret or tap into a node which was previously inaccessible or didn't offer a safe path forward. Tracing a line with my finger meant I could activate the space, raise a platform and create some new pathways. These basic mechanics were easy to grasp but quickly produced a few head-scratching problems. How do I trigger my invisibility in a way that will get me past the next turret? Can I change the map in a way that lets me hack the turret, thereby saving the power-up for a hurdle up ahead? ""We create complexity in a simple way,"" Etienne Giroux, a game designer at Square Enix Montreal explains. ""You're not constantly learning new rules, it's just that you realise these rules talk to each other. That they work together. And that's really the complexity that we go for in these games, because they have to be simple, they have to be graspable, and we like that anyone can think that it's easy for them to get into it."" ""We want to make the best experience possible in a level editor. One that people are going to remember."" Deus Ex Go will be a larger game than its Hitman and Tomb Raider predecessors. Square Enix Montreal is designing more levels this time around and is also working on a level editor -- a first for the Go franchise. It won't be ready in time for launch though, as the team is still working on the ""metagame"" and mechanics -- such as those found in Little Big Planet and Super Mario Maker -- that will drive players to make new stages. ""One of the reasons why it's coming later is that we don't just want to put a button there that says 'you can also make stuff.' We want to make the best experience possible in a level editor. One that people are going to remember, that will be the best editor you see on the App Store, and that will be actually usable,"" Giroux says. The editor will also help the team to speed up its own level production. Before, creating a new level pack meant pulling developers away from other projects. Now, with the tools it's developed for the community, the same work should require fewer people and less time. ""The idea was to make the decision easy for us,"" Giroux says. ""It's easy to take a decision to create more levels when 30 puzzles takes a couple of weeks with two guys. That's an easier decision for the studio than it is thinking about five or six guys working for three months."" In the future, that could include not just new levels, but also mechanics. Giroux says he's confident the community will find new, creative applications for these elements, far beyond what the developers originally intended. ""We know for sure that it won't be a long time before someone finds a way to use something in a way that we didn't, but that's cool!"" The Go games are designed for mobile devices, but their success has led to wider platform support. Hitman Go started on iOS and Android but has since come to PS4, Vita, PC and VR. Lara Croft Go has remained on phones and tablets, but that's not due to lack of demand elsewhere. The team says countless people have asked for a Vita version -- but similar to the new content conundrum, it has to decide when to move on and prioritize new projects. Deus Ex Go, at least at launch, will be mobile only too. As for the future? The studio is staying tight-lipped for now. With Hitman, Tomb Raider and Deus Ex, the team has covered all of the main Western properties owned by Square Enix. The developer's pedigree is attracting fresh talent too -- last month it picked up Teddy Dief, who developed Hyper Light Drifter, and Renaud Bedard, one of the programmers behind Fez. If the studio wants to try something new, now would be the perfect time to do it. Or rather, as soon as it's finished working on Deus Ex Go."

Well, it seems the company has started a trend. Square Enix and Eidos-Montreal have now teamed up with Open Bionics, a specialist in low-cost prosthetics, to develop some designs based on the world of Deus Ex. The franchise delves deep into a possible future where human augmentation is commonplace, changing society and warfare in equal measure. Two arms -- one based on Adam Jensen, the hero of Mankind Divided, another on the wider Deus Ex universe -- will be released next year as royalty-free designs that anyone can use. Open Bionics has already made prosthetic arms inspired by Iron Man, Frozen and Star Wars. The new designs look more impressive, however; the Adam Jensen arm (below) is full of detail, from its flexing fingers to the rotating wrist. The Titan arm (above), meanwhile, is more stylized with sharp, geometric shapes and angles. Both are colored in gunmetal grey and gold, reflecting the series and its augmented superhero. Eidos-Montreal and Open Bionics will be showing the arms at multiple game shows including E3 and Gamescom, with a little help from Razer. The company, most known for its gaming keyboards and mice, will be using its Stargazer webcam to track people's movements and show them what it would be like to control an artificial limb. They might not be as lethal as those used by Adam Jensen, but they look the part -- if they perform half as well, they could be attractive to amputees with a passion for the franchise."

Since it has a modular design, the company can swap in parts depending on what a particular mission needs. For instance, it could either use wheels or tracks, and its payload could be anything from robotic arms and sensors/radars to remote-controlled weapons.

Here, of course, the proposition is a little different. Tesco and Unlockd are offering advertisers a prime position on people's phones -- one that would normally be impossible to reach.

The co-founder of Google is hoping to make that future a reality, at least according to Bloomberg. It's published a report claiming that Larry Page has been secretly bankrolling Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two California startups working on developing a serious flying car. While the former is based on the edges of Google's Mountain View campus, Page's involvement has been considered a secret, until now. According to ten (ten!) sources familiar with the matter, Zee.Aero has developed a pair of prototype aircraft which it tests regularly. It has a facility close to a runway in Hollister in southern California, where locals claim to have seen weird craft hovering overhead. The report describes them as plane-like vehicles, with propellers in the rear -- one small enough for a single person, the other seemingly more capacious. Last year, website LongTailPipe found a patent detailing the firm's thinking, with rotor blades lining a plane-style cockpit. As top-secret as the project is, Zee.Aero engineers have been known to show off their skills, breaking the cruising record for unpowered flight at the 2013 Red Bull Flugtag.Zee.Aero engineers breaking the world record for unpowered flight. Kitty Hawk, meanwhile, was apparently spun out by Page as a competing project, led by Sebastian Thrun, founder of Google's X Lab. Thrun is also famous for being one of the minds behind the search engine's self-driving car project way back when. Page apparently believes that two companies, competing directly with each other, will help get the job done faster. The smaller firm is working on something closer to a quadcopter drone, reminding us of EHang's 184 passenger drone. Unfortunately, Bloomberg believes that merely reporting on Page's involvement with both firms might kill his dreams dead. It claims that the Google co-founder said that, if his connection was made public, he'd withdraw in an instant. Although maybe he's better off directing his energies toward a mode of transportation that'll help solve the problems more people face today, like mass transit."

As part of its duty to ""inform, educate and entertain,"" the broadcaster is effectively mandated to innovate -- to explore new technologies that can better serve the public. This is the job of BBC R&D, which is looking to virtual reality as a new way to tell stories, without the same commercial pressures other broadcasters face. There's a certain freedom in this, and it's allowing the BBC to go beyond 360-degree video and dip its toe into more immersive ""true VR"" experiences, with the first of these being published today. Easily accessible, 360-degree video has already found favour at the BBC. You don't even need a cheap headset like Google Cardboard to take a tour of the Large Hadron Collider, walk alongside a titanosaur with David Attenborough, learn about Rome's Pantheon or get the best seats in the house at a Strictly Come Dancing show. This type of content is (relatively) quick and inexpensive to produce, making it attractive in the nearer-term. The BBC's latest 360-degree video, launched today on BBC Taster, Facebook and YouTube, puts you in the front row of the recent dress rehearsal of ""Trooping the Colour,"" the annual pageant that this year will mark the Queen's 90th birthday. The beauty of 360-degree video is you can consume it on pretty much any device in one form of another. Aided by third-party expertise, though, the BBC has also begun testing more powerful hardware and creating ""true VR"" experiences in fully computer-generated worlds to tell stories in new and different ways. A couple of these early experiments are available to download from today on the BBC Taster site, including ""Easter Rising: Voice of a Rebel,"" created for the Oculus Rift. This almost dreamlike production puts you in the shoes of Willie McNieve, who participated in the Irish rebellion against British rule in Dublin, 1916. It succeeds in making this historical event an extremely personal one, using an audio account McNieve himself recorded to guide the story. Also designed for Oculus Rift and published on BBC Taster today is the slightly more arresting ""We Wait."" In it, you become one of a group of fictional migrants waiting in the night to cross from Turkey to Greece in an ill-suited smugglers' boat. Despite the angular looks of the computer-generated avatars, elements like the blinding flashlight beams, the rumble of the boat's small motor, and the shudder in your companions' voices leave you with a palpable sense of unease. On a lighter note, ""The Turning Forest"" is a modern VR fairytale that uses 3D audio to compelling effect. A rustle of leaves in the enchanted wood may be telling you where to look, or perhaps it's just a distraction. Several light, interactive elements anchor you in this psychedelic fantasy, while a giant friend takes you on a journey of pure escapism. ""The Turning Forest"" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year, and will be available for the Oculus Rift via BBC Taster in the coming months. Probably the BBC's most ambitious project, ""Home - A VR Spacewalk"" uses the HTC Vive and motion controllers to put you to work on the International Space Station. My demo also entailed wearing a heart-rate monitor that fed real-time data and sound back into my spacesuit, and sitting in a haptic feedback chair for even greater immersion. The premise of the player-driven experience is simple: get out there and repair some minor external damage. It ends up being far from simple. Debuting at the Sheffield Doc/Fest today alongside several other VR experiences, it'll be available on BBC Taster later this year. These first steps into ""true VR"" aren't just an opportunity for the BBC to explore different headset hardware, virtual reality formats and techniques, but a range of content too: from educational to emotive, entertaining to unnerving. The BBC is well aware that only the earliest of adopters have Rifts and Vives at home, but there was also a time when TV was a brand new medium, and sets scarce. By conducting these trials, the BBC wants to put itself in a position to work with VR if and when powerful headsets become more common. ""The BBC's storytelling tradition is all around experiences,"" BBC R&D Controller Andy Conroy told me. ""I suspect somewhere in here is one of the genres where that notion of 'experiencing VR' is the perfect way of telling that story. And that's what it'll add to us."""

This is the first Destiny expansion to hit current-generation consoles only -- there's no word on Xbox 360 or PS3 releases. Rise of Iron brings back the Gjallarhorn rocket launcher, a weapon that was over-powered in the game's early days but fell off once Destiny entered Year Two. For those who pre-order the new content, the Gjallarhorn comes in an ""Iron Black"" color, fitting the whole ferrous theme. Rise of Iron also introduces a new social space called The Plaguelands Zone. The expansion costs $30 and requires players own the Destiny base game plus The Taken King. Details about Rise of Iron leaked a tad early, but today's livestream confirmed the expansion's offerings. The story dives into the history of the Iron Lords, a faction of Guardians who were tasked with watching over Old Russia from a snowy, craggy mountain range called Felwinter Peak. The Iron Lords sacrificed themselves to keep a great evil at bay, but that plague returns for players to defeat once again. The story also reveals who Jolder is -- she (that's right, she) already has a legendary machine gun named after her, and players will discover what makes her so noteworthy in Destiny's lore. Destiny will get a sequel in 2017 and E3 is right around the corner -- that show kicks off on Sunday, June 12th with press conferences from EA and Bethesda, followed by Xbox, Ubisoft and PlayStation on Monday. We'll be live on the ground delivering the latest gaming news all week."

Following on the heels of the LG G5 and Google's ""Project Ara"" concept, Motorola today unveiled its new Moto Z flagship, which makes use of various modular accessories. These add-ons, collectively dubbed MotoMods, snap onto the handset using a quartet of magnets and draw their power/data through a 6Gbps multi-pin connection. There will be three Mods available at launch: a projector, ""party speaker"" and an external battery.  Lenovo has already built a projector into a tablet, so it's not a huge surprise to now see Motorola creating a snap-on pico projector case. The Moto Insta-Share Projector (MISP, for short) combines a built-in kickstand with a teensy 50-lumen lamp that can beam a 70-inch image onto nearby walls. Its onboard battery allows for an hour of showtime, though you if you want you can plug the phone into a wall charger via its USB-C connection. The projector will also output audio to an external stereo using Bluetooth or the USB-C so you aren't stuck with the phone's rinkydink native speaker. The JBL speaker does exactly what you think it does. It offers 6W stereo sound, 80-decibel volume and 10-hour battery life. Like the projector mod, this too has a built-in kickstand, and can charge as it plays using a USB-C connection. The Incipio Power Pack straps on a massive 2,220mAh backup battery rated to provide an extra 22 hours of runtime. That's not quite as huge as, say, the Galaxy S7 Active's 4,000 mAh cell, but it's certainly a nice complement to the Moto Z's onboard 2,600mAh pack, which is rated for 30 hours. What's more, these power packs will be available in more stylish designs from designers Kate Spade and Tumi. There will also be a version that charges wirelessly. These first few Mods are just the beginning as far as Moto Z accessories go. The Moto Z line will also include a series of snap-on cases in a bunch of exotic materials like wood and cloth. Motorla's Seang Chau also hinted at upcoming collaborations with battery-case maker, Mophie, and a camera pack as well. In addition to developing its own, Motorola is also launching the Moto Mods Developer Program. Through it, the company will partner with the Lenovo Capital and Incubator Group (LCIG) to provide both seed funding for certified developers as well as $1 million in equity funding for whoever submits a winning MotoMod prototype. As you can see, Motorola hasn't yet announced pricing for any of these accessories. Expect more details on that closer to the phone's launch date.

The Phab2 Pro (check out our hands-on impressions right here) is special because it fulfills the promise of demos Google's Advanced Technologies and Products (ATAP) division has been showing off for several years now. Google and Lenovo have worked with developers, scientists and other companies to create apps built around the unique capabilities included in the Phab2 Pro. Dual cameras create an ""eye"" that sees the phone's location in 3D with depth perception, while additional sensors that monitor its surroundings 250,000 times per second. Gallery: Lenovo Phab2 Pro | 6 Photos 6 +2  Google and Lenovo have shown off experiences that use the Tango technology to provide augmented reality-guided tours in museums, and even odd experiences like Woorld, but there are more practical applications. Lowe's has an app that it says will allow homeowners to remodel by envisioning how appliances or furniture will look in their space virtually. Lenovo VP Jeff Meredith envisions the technology becoming ""pervasive, just like GPS."" Despite shrinking to a size usable by human hands and coming with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, each Phab2 packs a large 4,050mAh battery, along with Dolby Atmos audio features, including the ability to record sound in 5.1 surround. But the similarities end there. The Pro elevates things to the stratosphere with premium specs and sensing abilities that trump any phone we've seen before -- all with a price of $500, unlocked. The Pro also adds on a specially designed eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, 64GB of built-in storage (expandable via microSD), 4GB of RAM and a 2,560 x 1,440 ""assertive"" display. All of these phones are scheduled to arrive globally in September, while the Tango-enabled Phab2 Pro will be sold at Lowe's and Best Buy stores, and online by the end of the year.

At launch, you'll have six modules to choose from: a GPS unit, an extra battery, a pulse sensor, a humidity/temperature/altitude sensor, a programmable button and a flashlight. Blocks says add-ons for body temperature, perspiration, fingerprint authentication and gesture control are in the works. Since the platform is open, third-party developers can make more parts as well. Each Blocks purchase comes with a watch face unit, called a ""Core,"" along with four modules that form the strap; larger-wristed folks can go up to five links.

They deserve far more credit than they're getting, but there's no denying that they've never fully escaped deep nerd territory. That, our friends, is what you call a branding problem. And from the looks of it, X-Men: Apocalypse hasn't solved it. Coming in at $80 million domestically (modest for a holiday weekend, especially compared to Days of Future Past's $110.5 million opening weekend), it's no juggernaut. Sure, it took the top spot, but its competition was the unasked-for and the ridiculous: Alice Through the Looking Glass and Angry Birds. So, as we've done before with other blockbusters, we dug around the Internet to track the successes and failures of Apocalypse's marketing campaign. It's got all the right moves--nostalgia, ""accessible"" stars, app-based stunts--but it falls a little short of having that spark. And once the box-office projections came in, things got a little...awkward. Going Retro Admittedly, things start out kinda sweet. Apocalypse's '80s vibes have been fun from the beginning, and the marketing campaign has embraced and made the most of that throwback nostalgia. To wit: this kitschy, lo-res fake commercial for Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, starring Jubilee (Lana Condor): Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is now open for enrollment! #XMenApocalypsehttps://t.co/B3KSNPz05A -- X-Men Movies (@XMenMovies) May 19, 2016 Or this fake ad for an episode of In the Footsteps of ...

Superman stodginess, the X-Men franchise still doesn't feel entirely of-the-moment. So it's not a surprise that big portions of their marketing campaign feel distinctly youngs-friendly.

Absolutely not. Is it inoffensive and fine? Sure. Despite starring Internet darling Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: Apocalypse has a bit of a star power problem--at least where social is concerned. J-Law shines on late-night TV (and rakes in next-day YouTube views), but she hasn't done much more than that, and she's pretty clearly on her way out of the franchise. In the age of personality-driven viral marketing, Shipp and Turner and Hoult are too unfamiliar to rest a campaign on. If you want evidence, just check the total retweets and favorites that the above tweets--then compare that to this single, banal Hugh Jackman tweet. In honor of the 30th Anniversary of the move Top Gun and, of course, the all important #TBT - call sign WOLVERINE pic.twitter.com/IiqDLSumHe -- Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) May 19, 2016 Apps and App Takeovers Some of Fox's more modern marketing techniques have been more successful (or at least, more noticed). While the standalone X-Men Movies app was basically a clunkier, X-centric Instagram, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to finish what Deadpool's Tinder account started. The Apocalypse marketing team bought out Snapchats's lenses for a day, and replaced them with ones that literally turned Snapchat users into X-Men. TK PHOTOS Not everyone was happy that it was now mandatory for them to become X-Men rather than a cute dog and someone puking a rainbow, but this was actually legitimately cool. (Snapchat also debuted a new feature where you could buy X-Men: Apocalypse tickets in-app.) So: points for effort and creativity, but demerits for the fact that the movie tried to make us put its faces on our faces. Which is maybe the most 2016 thing we've written in some time. The (Defensive) Aftermath Maybe because things never quite clicked with the whole viral marketing thing, publicity efforts seem to have taken a sharp right. For a number of days now, the movie's official Twitter account has been a retweet machine, and the message they're trying to drive home is pretty unambiguous. #XMenApocalypse was better than some of the harshest reviews suggest. Some great scenes honouring the comics heritage. Good fun. -- Sir Jay Brane-Jarr (@thebraininajar) May 26, 2016 Don't agree with all the bad reviews of #XMenApocalypse . Not the best X-Men movie yes, but a fun ride all the same. -- Paul Healy (@PaulHealy300) May 26, 2016 x men apocalypse is frickin AWESOME! just ignore those useless critics #XMenApocalypse -- teuku heru (@teuku_h) May 26, 2016 No, Apocalypse Twitter, don't do it! Calm down, and listen to Liz Lemon: Regardless of critical response, the X-Men are always going to have a place in our hearts, in nerd culture, and in the multiplex. It's just maybe not going to be right there alongside Batman or the Avengers. Embrace your nature, X-Men promotional campaign engineers: There's so much more to you than you know. Go Back to Top.

Perhaps you'd like to stay in and do some binge-watching? Netflix has plenty to help you with that impulse. From six hours of awesome dino action to a whole new season of the massively addicting Orange Is the New Black, there's quite a bit coming to the streaming service this month to fill the days. Here's the programming you should prioritize this June. June 1 Jurassic Park (1993)/ The Lost World (1997) / Jurassic Park III (2001) This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!) But the the three original Jurassic movies are a fine Plan B in the absence of prehistoric thrills at the cineplex. All together, it's around six hours of (mostly) amazing dinosaur action. Say goodbye to a Saturday. This summer, there won't be a another Jurassic World. (Bummer!)

Say goodbye to a Saturday. June 10 Voltron: Legendary Defender (2016) The reboots of cartoons from the 1980s continues with Netflix's Voltron. The original series was about five young pilots who find flying lion robots and combine them into one giant warrior. In the new show, five students at a flight academy stumble upon one of the lions, and get whisked away to become a team and defend the universe. Get excited, cartoon fans.

June 17 Orange Is The New Black, Season 4 (2016) Jenji Kohan's Netflix Original has come a long way from the early days of Piper Chapman at Litchfield Penitentiary, adding in backstories for many different inmates along the way. The fourth season will continue last year's for-profit prison storyline as Litchfield adds more guards, restricts the inmates even further, and sees tensions ratchet up to new levels.

June 22 Spotlight (2015) This year's Oscar winner for Best Picture, about the Boston Globe journalists who uncovered a long history of abuse within the Catholic Church, is by no means a flashy movie, but it's persistent and picks its moments of stylistic emphasis carefully. It's the latest film to carry on the legacy of All The President's Men and Zodiac, illuminating the people who put in hours of hard work to bring stories to the public.

June 24 The Fundamentals of Caring (2016) Fundamentals stars Paul Rudd as a grieving father who takes a job as the caregiver for a teenager with a rare disease. They embark on a road trip to see tourist traps, and along the way connect with a foul-mouthed runaway. If that sounds like a movie made from the spare parts of a million Sundance films, it is. But that also makes it worth a watch. Fundamentals stars Paul Rudd as a grieving father who takes a job as the caregiver for a teenager with a rare disease.

Aside from prohibiting murder, there are essentially no rules. In this doc about the event--known as the Palio di Siena--the producers follow the story of a veteran jockey and his former apprentice, now rivals in the fiercest horse race this side of Churchill Downs.

When the 2015-2016 season began, the league included 100 international players (out of 446 total) from 37 countries. The Association's popularity is still growing internationally, thanks to a combination of international outreach, technological savvy, and openness--as crystallized by these eight marquee moments that helped the basketball go global. 1992 The Dream Team In 1989, FIBA, the international governing body of basketball, decided to allow professional players in the NBA could be just like professionals in other leagues around the world, and compete in international tournaments. Despite then-commissioner David Stern's misgivings, the United States sent the Dream Team to Barcelona for the 1992 Summer Olympics, and finally the best basketball players in the world had the attention of an international audience. The superstar-laden roster is legendary--Jordan, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Johnson, Bird, Ewing, Mullin, Robinson, Barkley, Drexler (and Laettner, the only non-Hall of Famer)--and utterly dominated the tournament, where they won games by an average of 44 points. The public reception in Spain was ecstatic--coach Chuck Daly likened it to ""Elvis and The Beatles put together""--and the team's effect on the game was immediately felt. Then-IOC chair Juan Antonion Samaranch called the basketball tournament ""the most important aspect of the Games.""

But the most important step toward mass-audience international broadcasting was getting the league's games on the air in China. CCTV-China aired every game of the 1994 Finals between Houston and New York, making it the first time the country carried every game of the championship series live. It was a clear sign of rising interest in the sport. The Chinese Basketball Association began playing a year later in 1995, quickly expanded (it currently has 20 teams), and the country remains one of the most vibrant overseas professional leagues for players who don't quite make the cut in the NBA.

But the league decided to follow Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League and expand to Canada, founding the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors, making the ""National"" in its name a bit of a misnomer. Unfortunately, the Grizziles didn't last long in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, but the Raptors have held on in Toronto, making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history this season.

Satellite and cable providers carry league packages for all games, and now each league is waking up to the internet streaming model to make games available to cord-cutters. But the NBA began experimenting with putting its games online 20 years ago, when it started ""cybercasting"" games worldwide over the internet using ESPNET SportsZone. It took many years for streaming technology to be so widely available and fast that fans would demand access to games via the internet, but broadcasting internet audio in the 1990s shows an impressive amount of foresight, even as an experiment.

But that's not true for Michael Jordan, whose pioneering shoe endorsements paved the way for almost every significant player since. And it's also not true of recently-retired Kobe Bryant, who remains one of the most popular players overseas even as his career precipitously declined in the NBA. Much of that popularity can be traced back to the first international trip he took to Australia, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines before the 1998-1999 season. Since then, he's gone back an additional nine times--his 2015 Asian Summer Tour with Nike hit Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Taipei. Bryant is the model for international basketball stardom, not simply doing his work on the court during the season, but taking the time to develop an iconic persona everywhere in the world people play and watch basketball. Few players have marketed themselves individually to international fans with lucrative and enduring success quite like Bryant.

(The essential 30 For 30 installment Once Brothers traces the bond between eastern European stars Vlade Divac and Drazen Petrovic in the late 1980s and early 1990s.) But the decade after the Dream Tream saw international players emerge on a level previously unseen in the NBA. German wunderkind Dirk Nowitzki, who impressed Charles Barkley during international camps as a teenager, arrived in 1998 and by the early 2000s had begun a streak of 10 consecutive All-Star appearances. And the 2000 draft saw 14 international players selected, with seven in the first round. But seven-foot six-inch Chinese center Yao Ming, taken first overall by the Houston Rockets in 2002, is perhaps the most significant international player in the history of the NBA. While other international players had more success on the court, Yao was an unmissable icon who gave millions of Chinese fans a patriotic reason to follow the NBA. Though he only played eight (injury-shortened) seasons and made the playoffs four times in Houston, his cultural impact was so undeniable that Yao was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Allen Iverson and Shaquille O'Neal in 2016.

But since joining, the league has been by leaps and bounds the most savvy official league account with regard to engaging with fans and cultivating new ones using wide-reaching social media channels. The league doesn't just employ a hands-off approach to fans enthusiastically circulating highlights, it actively encourages users to share videos and pictures that help continue conversations about dunks, long threes, incredible passes, or controversial moments. Takedown notices are nowhere to be found. Instead, NBA Twitter is a raucous and celebratory environment where every great play can be looped millions of times, and every tragic loss gets a Crying Jordan within the hour. And that makes it the most fun sport to watch at home while following along with the conversation online.

Two cameras--one stationed courtside and another up in the rafters, beamed video to Samsung Gear VR users via the NextVR app. Front-row experiences vary by sport. It's arguably more fun to be in the stands where it's possible to catch a foul ball or a home run in baseball instead of behind the plate. And football is best viewed where it's possible to see the whole field of play. But basketball is exhilarating from up close, and because the court is small enough it's still possible to see everything going on from that vantage point. VR livestreams have expanded to other big-time sporting events (the U.S. Open) and other limited-access experiences (this year's Coachella music festival offered 360 video for its main stage), but it's entirely possible that in the foreseeable future, NBA League Pass will include some kind of provision for courtside VR viewing at a fraction of the cost of an actual ticket. And watching in VR means you're not part of the problem if your team's star player goes headfirst into the stands and nobody steps in to catch him.

It's not designed to help you."" The president sounded at turns exasperated and confounded as he addressed the people of Elkhart, Indiana, a town he last visited during the throes of the recession in 2009, and which he said he chose today ""precisely because this county votes Republican."" ""If the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you who will have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class,"" Obama told the crowd before laying out what he believes the differences between those visions are. For Obama, the speech was a chance to boast about his administration's economic achievements--including the country's consistent job growth and a shrinking deficit--while bashing the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who Obama believes would derail that progress. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama took Trump to task over everything from his tax policies to immigration to trade to his ""provocative"" tweets. ""I'm not here looking for votes,"" Obama said. ""I'm here because I care deeply as a citizen about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over the last seven and a half years."" Populist POTUS Not that Obama shied away from sounding the kind of populist note that has characterized the 2016 campaign season. He called Trump's proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants ""a fantasy"" and rejected the idea that immigrants are responsible for stagnating wages in this country. Instead, he laid the blame on another popular target--corporate elites. ""Those decisions are made in the board rooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker,"" he said. He went on to frame Trump as a candidate who only has the interests of the rich at heart. He attacked Trump's plans to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, and lambasting his proposed tax plan which would provide a major tax cut to the top .1 percent of American earners. ""That will not make your lives better,"" Obama said. ""That will help people like him."" Trade-offs On trade, Obama called the idea that ""other countries are killing us on trade,"" which is a frequent Trump talking point, a myth. He argued, instead, that while trade and technological advancement have hurt certain industries, they've helped others, like agriculture and technology. He also emphasized the importance of trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership in dictating the terms of trade. ""If you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century, and they're trying, then TPP makes sure we set the rules,"" Obama said. On that point, at least, Obama was not just fighting Trump's anti-trade rhetoric. Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have publicly opposed the deal as well. With that exception, the president's talk could have easily been ripped from the stump speeches of either of the Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. On nearly every economic issue--from pay equity to labor standards to investment in infrastructure--Obama painted a doomsday scenario on the right. ""When I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention,"" Obama said. ""If we fall for a bunch of okey doke, just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.""

On Saturday night, Bernie Sanders' supporters reportedly revolted against the Nevada Democratic Party, accusing it of intentionally rigging the convention to favor Hillary Clinton. The fight continued throughout the weekend as aggrieved Sanders supporters deluged Nevada Democratic Chair Roberta Lange with sexist and threatening texts and voicemails. Today, the Vermont senator issued a statement condemning any instances of violence carried out by his supporters. At the same time, he denounced what he called a corrupt system within the Nevada state party. ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,"" Sanders said in a statement. But, he added: ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" At issue is the fact that though Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign has been actively organizing to win county conventions. By amassing more delegates at these county conventions, the Sanders campaign stood to cut into Clinton's delegate lead at the statewide convention. But the Nevada State Democratic Party denied credentials to 64 of Sanders' delegates, saying that they either weren't registered as Democrats or that their records couldn't be verified. In the end, six of them received credentials, but the vote still tipped in Clinton's favor. The room soon erupted in protests. Meanwhile, the chaotic scene has created waves within Sanders' massive Reddit community as well. Moderators are urging Sanders supporters to avoid the kind of language that could get them in trouble with the media. ""They're  expecting  us to act this way. If we take the bait and react violently and/or with threats of violence, we play right into their hands,"" one moderator wrote. ""Remember, what would Bernie do?"" Setting aside the issue of violence, however, it's a little ironic to see the Sanders campaign accusing the state party of rigging the contest. Sanders has often criticized party leaders for trying to subvert the will of the people. But in this case, it's Clinton who won the Nevada caucus to begin with and Sanders who's using the cryptic system of delegate math to gain the edge.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Bernie Sanders election 2016 Florida Senator Marco Rubio at a rally on March 14, 2016 in Miami. RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it anymore. Last night, in a Tweetstorm for the ages, the Florida Senator let loose a torrent of frustrations about what has been the most absurd election cycle in recent memory. And can you blame him? It's been a rough year for Rubio. Once thought to be the Republican party's great hope, instead he spent this election cycle being repeatedly ridiculed for his height, his urge to stay well hydrated, his possibly overactive sweat glands, and more. He not only lost his home state of Florida, but he opted not to run for re-election to the Senate. With the exception of his Marcorobot meltdown during the New Hampshire debate, the young Senator mostly retained his composure. But with just months left until he's a private citizen again, Rubio is taking a note straight from the Donald Trump playbook, and telling it like it is on Twitter. The flint to Rubio's fire last night seemed to have been a Washington Post article alleging that he is ""betwixt and between"" on his next move. Funny to read about unnamed ""people close"" to me who claim to know my thinking on future plans.They just make it up. https://t.co/jiEYMugVHz -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Unnamed sources ""close to"" often just people who want to sound like they are in the know.

Words I have NEVER said to anyone. https://t.co/VZ9J7wznsZ -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Then Rubio really upped the attitude: Another genius line claims that Im ""a bit at sea in terms of his next step politically"".

Twitter isn't something you should just rush back into. You have to slowly increase the dosage....... -- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 17, 2016 Let's dispel with this fiction that Marco Rubio doesn't know what he's doing.

It's blaring from the speakers mounted nearby--""Shadow,"" a ballad he wrote and produced with his friend Sam Tsui a few years ago--but he hasn't played the song in a while, and can't remember the piano part. (When you've arranged, recorded, produced, written, directed, edited, and mixed more than 300 songs and videos, you tend to forget a few things.) Schneider hunches over his Yamaha keyboard, boxers sticking out the back of his jeans; after a minute of banging around, the muscle memory kicks in, and the part comes back. Then, just as suddenly, it's time to go. He slips on his shoes, runs his hands through his messy hair, and jumps in his car to head to tonight's shoot. Over the next several hours, Schneider will direct, produce, and perform in a music video for a cover of the song ""Roses"" by the Chainsmokers. Schneider arranged, mixed, and recorded the audio on this one--but he's not the star of this video. That would be Tsui, his closest collaborator, who recorded the vocals yesterday in Schneider's home studio. Schneider's rarely the star of his videos, but he's without question the star of his channel. And like many of the platform's stars, YouTube has made him famous. Like, 7 million subscribers and more than a billion views famous. One of Schneider's biggest fans is actually in town: Kayla, the 16-year-old whose only wish for Christmas vacation was to fly to LA to meet Schneider and Tsui. They both know who she is, because she's one of the super-duperfans who comments on and shares absolutely everything they do. Her mom reached out to Schneider months earlier, and Schneider and Tsui decided to surprise her. So they told Kayla no, sorry, too busy, but offered to have a friend give her a tour of ""a studio they shoot in sometimes"" that's owned by Alex Goot, another well-known YouTuber. As she enters an abandoned-looking building in an industrial neighborhood of downtown LA, Kayla has no idea what's waiting for her upstairs. Schneider at his home recording studio. Julian Berman for WIRED Tsui is behind the piano; Schneider sits on a wooden stool with a guitar on his lap. (He re-learned the piano part for nothing, apparently.) They've set up another stool just inside the door for Kayla to sit on. When Kayla opens the door, the guys start to play. As Tsui sings the first lines of ""Shadow""--Kayla's favorite song--Kayla practically melts onto the stool. Her whole body is shaking. When I ask her a few minutes later how she felt, she can barely answer. ""This is the best day of my life you're witnessing right now,"" she says, without ever taking her eyes off Schneider. After a few minutes of serenading, selfies, and chatter, Schneider shoos the rest of us into a corner of the large square room. He drags the piano across the floor toward a better-lit corner, and stands Tsui in front of a microphone in the exact center of the room. It's time to shoot tonight's video, for the millions of other fans who don't get to watch live. A couple of weeks from now, Schneider will publish it on his YouTube channel, where his 7 million followers will devour their new take on ""Roses."" The comments will say the same things they always do, the same things you'd see on a Bieber video or shouted at the One Directioners. ""Wow, this version is much better then the original."" ""This gives me the chills omg, so amazing."" ""this is a million times better than that radio trash."" In case you hadn't noticed, YouTube has taken over the music industry. A much-cited Nielsen study in 2012 found that more teens listen to music on YouTube than any other platform. A similar study in 2015 showed that YouTube accounts for fully half of all music streaming. Radio's not dead, and neither is iTunes. But they're not the future; YouTube is. And Kurt Hugo Schneider--he goes by all three names professionally, or KHS for short--may just be the most powerful YouTuber musician on the planet. He's among the most prominent of this new kind of artist: native to the Internet, skilled in everything from video production to sultry falsetto to distribution strategy. Together, these artists are charting a new path to fame and fortune that begins, and increasingly ends, on YouTube. There are plenty of YouTube success stories. But Schneider is different. He can sing and dance, sure, but he takes most pleasure in being the guy behind the piano (and camera, and mixing board, and editing suite). He's a producer in an era where everyone wants to be the frontman. He's become the hub of a teeming group of YouTuber musicians; in fact, he's responsible for elevating and breaking many of their careers. Schneider is Rick Rubin for a new generation. You bring him a good voice, he'll make something everyone wants to see. The entertainer Music may be Schneider's life and work now, but when the 27-year-old really wants to show off, he'll play two games of chess at a time. Blindfolded. ""All the great players can do it,"" he says, shrugging. While he was growing up outside of Philadelphia, Schneider's parents had a rule: you can do and be anything you want, but you have to practice something. After four weeks of piano lessons, young Kurt decided music wasn't it. He eventually landed on chess, which consumed his life for a decade. He became a chess master at 15, and was one of the best junior players in the country. As he got to the end of high school, though, he'd reached the point where the only way to get better was to commit fully. ""It doesn't matter if it's chess or ballet or sports,"" he says, over bowls of pho at a small restaurant down the street from his new house. ""If you want to be the best at something, you have to do it to the exclusion of everything else."" Unwilling to make the sacrifice, Schneider mostly stopped playing chess, and began college at Yale in 2006 the way most kids begin college: completely unsure about the future. Yale has a renowned music program, but Schneider declared a math major because he knew he'd ace his classes without trying very hard. It came easy; he still remembers the one B+ he got, and that was only because he accidentally skipped the midterm. (He wound up graduating magna cum laude, which says a little about grade inflation and a lot about the fact that Schneider seems to be exceptional at basically everything he tries.) While he was supposed to be in class, he was mostly hanging out in the school's Digital Media Center for the Arts. He'd gotten a job there, mostly for the perks: unfettered off-hours access to two studios, plus a whole bunch of audio and video recording equipment. The studio quickly became a second home--Schneider and his friends kept a sleeping bag in one of the recording rooms, just in case. Julian Berman for WIRED With help from a much-loved lab director named Lee Faulkner, Schneider began learning his way around the lab's many systems: software like Logic and Cubase, the ins and outs of recording and mixing. Once he had a grasp of things, he started inviting music students to work with him. He needed guinea pigs, and they needed his help.They were all good musicians, but had no idea how to make themselves sound good. ""All their recordings sounded terrible,"" Schneider remembers. ""Underwater, muffled, just bad."" So he made them all the same offer: come to the studio, do your thing, and he'd handle the rest. At the same time, he was beginning to experiment with all the camera equipment in the studio. In a world full of great music, he'd realized at some point, music isn't enough. ""Most musicians on YouTube focus entirely on the audio,"" he says. ""But if people just wanted to hear something great they would go on Spotify or Pandora, or open their iTunes library or something. You go on YouTube because you want to see something really cool."" The first video Schneider ever put on YouTube--the reason he created his channel in the first place--was a commercial he made for Yale's closed-circuit TV network, YTV. Schneider wrote a shockingly catchy song about two kids who don't want to go out and party, they just want to hang out in their dorm and watch YTV. It played all over campus, and its two stars became minor campus celebrities. Weeks later, a blog called IvyGate, which is like Gawker for Ivy Leaguers and is a real thing that exists, saw the spot. The post wasn't nice--""YTV Attempts to Out-Gay Harvard Crooner,"" the headline snarked--but it sent 15,000 viewers to his campy commercial. Schneider couldn't believe there were so many people watching dumb videos online. And he wanted to make more of them. In 2007, though, ""YouTuber"" wasn't a job title. And YouTube was only beginning to figure out its place in the music world. No Label Necessary It's still doing that, actually. The music industry wants more money out of YouTube, but it desperately needs YouTube's unmatched size and reach. Even as the platform has grown to a billion-plus users and an effectively infinite video catalog, music remains its most popular genre by far. And over time, the platform has shifted from a discovery engine to a full-fledged music platform. YouTube Red lets you listen without ads; YouTube Music is a rich and dedicated streaming service. And the platform is still uniquely artist-friendly. ""You see some of the successful YouTube artists,"" says industry analyst Mark Mulligan, ""they started off doing covers, because covers is an immediate way to build a relationship with an audience."" They'd show up in related videos and search results, and fans would encounter artists that felt like more than a faceless brand. That kind of interaction was critical. ""They're liking and sharing, remixing, covering music that they love,"" says Vivien Lewit, YouTube's head of artist relations. ""And that expression and new creation of sorts, just helps drive new community around video."" Now, most high-profile YouTubers like Schneider could get record deals in an instant. Labels are clamoring to sign them. And that used to be the goal. ""Part of my function many years ago,"" Lewit says, ""was that I would be someone who would try to present opportunities to the artists by introducing them to record labels."" She still works to land artists like Schneider deals for TV, movies, and books, but YouTube is the center of the universe. ""Signing a deal to a record label or TV network isn't going to give you as big an audience as you have on YouTube,"" Mulligan says. ""And it will constrain what you can do."" This new breed of do-everything artists want control. And it's not like they need radio play to get discovered. Julian Berman for WIRED For Schneider, keeping control means freedom to try weird stuff. And weird stuff is, at least in part, what's made him so successful. You can see it all the way back to October of 2008, in the first video that Schneider likes enough to still have public on his channel. It's a cover of ""Can I Have This Dance,"" from High School Musical 3. Schneider and some friends saw the movie on opening weekend, and knew the song would be a hit. So he asked Tsui and another friend, Rachel, if they wanted to record a duet. Both said sure, but the night before, Rachel cancelled. Schneider had been playing around with an idea, though. Maybe he could clone Tsui, so the singer would be able to duet with himself. And maybe that would be cooler. Maybe people would share it. He recorded four different vocal parts with Tsui, then stayed up all night editing and mixing and learning how to do the whole cloning thing. The video opens on two empty stools in front of a white screen. You can see the rolls of paper on the floor, and the frame for the screen around the edges. (Schneider's production value has gone up a bit since this video.) Tsui walks out in a red sweatshirt, holding a microphone. He sits down, smiles, and starts singing. A few seconds later, another Tsui comes out. Same red sweatshirt, same microphone. He sits in the stool next to himself, and starts singing the harmony. Two other Tsuis come and go throughout the song. Even watching it now, it's a cool effect. In its first day, the video got 1,000 views. ""It was probably because the movie was popular,"" Schneider says, ""so people were searching for the song."" It was Schneider's biggest debut yet, and validation of his theory about shareability. Ever since that day, he gives the same advice to people who ask about how to be successful on YouTube. ""You have to answer the question, 'why does someone want to share this video?' And if you don't have an answer to that question, it's probably not going to do well."" Good singers singing songs? Fine. Good singers singing popular, new songs? Better. A guy singing a duet with himself? Now that's shareable. Go down the list of YouTube's most popular music videos, and there's always that one thing that made people share it. That's the secret sauce. If you want to talk shareable, though, what happened in June of 2009 might be hard for Schneider--or anyone--to top. Michael Jackson had just died, and a friend asked him to arrange a medley for his Duke a cappella group, which they'd sing as a tribute. Schneider did the arrangement, and decided it was too good to just use for one concert and never hear again. So he and Tsui made a video. This time it's six Tsuis on stage, singing the medley in six-part harmony, with Schneider off to the left on percussion. Schneider uploaded the video on July 24, 2009. About a month later, it had about 100,000 views, which was ""by far the best any video had ever done for us,"" Schneider says. But then on August 29, Perez Hilton, the snark-tastic blogger still at the peak of his powers, tweeted the video. Cue explosion. By the next day, the video was on Fox News and the Yahoo homepage. Ellen DeGeneres called. So did Oprah. By the end of that summer, Schneider and Tsui had gone fully, certifiably, life-changingly viral. And things never really slowed down again. Gaming the Change Fast forward to 2016, and Schneider's is now the 34th most popular music channel on YouTube, and number 121 overall. (Number 122? The NBA.) On the music list, virtually everyone above Schneider is either Miley Cyrus or someone equally mainstream. Still below him on the charts? Calvin Harris, Lady Gaga, and, uh, everyone else on the planet. He adds about 3,300 new subscribers every day. He's done branded videos with companies like Samsung, Buick, and Coca-Cola, including a Coke ad that ran during the Super Bowl. He's as big a star as anyone on YouTube not named PewDiePie. But the more Schneider has come to understand how YouTube and the Internet work, the more he understands how unstable it all can be. And in the YouTube music scene, there's no more cautionary tale than Dave Days. In 2011, Days and his pop-punk song covers and parodies had more subscribers than any other musician on YouTube. But he never changed his approach, or his material, and now his subscriber and view counts dwindle toward zero. It's easy to win fans on the Internet, and even easier to lose them. Julian Berman for WIRED Schneider's way of staying relevant is to constantly change. As soon as Schneider masters something, he moves onto something else, not unlike the way Louis CK throws out his material every year and starts over. He has to: the YouTube zeitgeist moves so quickly, and so many people are copying and learning from the videos they see, that it's hard to ever remember who did things first. After Schneider's cover of Nelly's ""Just a Dream"" came out, for instance, people loved the editing style he'd used. He calls it a box edit, layering three or four instruments and singers simultaneously into the frame. It immediately became his most popular video, racking up more than 100 million views to date, and Schneider attributes the success at least in part to the editing style. But as soon as it went viral, he says, ""everybody fucking ripped it off."" Schneider doesn't curse much, and always apologizes when he does. But this stuff makes him mad. And it makes him try harder. Over time, he's ramped up the difficulty of his work to the point where it's hard to even copy--like the one-take videos he's become known for, artfully choreographed so that as the camera moves through a house, or down the street, the talent flows all around the frame. Every shoot starts in Schneider's notebook: ""I draw the room,"" he says, ""and then each person is a letter."" He draws everyone's path, and they shoot over and over until they get it right. Schneider's done one-takes on Segways and hoverboards, and he has this idea about having the singers catch and release a drone during a one-take. He's done a couple of 360-degree videos, too. And he loves playing weird instruments, or playing three instruments in one video, or using traffic sounds as percussion. He does popular songs, old songs, more and more original songs. Even when he does branded videos, he finds cool ways to integrate the product--forget just driving in a Buick, he's going to make every sound in the video with a Buick. He's on a relentless search for the next shareable thing. And he has a unique freedom to experiment because it's what his audience expects. That goes all the way back to the fact that it's not just Schneider on camera. ""Most channels on YouTube,"" Schneider says, ""especially music channels, it's just the artist. And every video is this person singing. Or whatever. Whereas my channel, I can have anyone singing. I can kind of do anything."" This approach has turned Schneider into a resource not just for other YouTubers looking for an edge, but for anyone looking for new ideas about music videos. When Avicii wanted to make the first-ever 360-degree music video for his song ""Waiting for Love,"" he called Schneider. So did Rixton, for ""Me And My Broken Heart."" ""I think if it was just a normal music video, I wouldn't be at the top of the list to direct it,"" Schneider says. But because it's YouTube, and because it's new tech, he's the guy. (A few days before we meet, fellow YouTube sensation Todrick Hall called Schneider for 360-degree shooting tips.) Schneider's worked with other A-listers like Jason Derulo and Hunter Hayes, YouTube stars like Bethany Mota, and many more. He recently struck a deal with Sony to do videos with some of the label's top talent, too. ""I was attracted to him for his director's eye, and his creative videos,"" says Lee Stimmel, Sony's head of original content. ""They're really, really different. And it's hard to stand out in that space."" In every case, it's the same offer as always: come to the studio, do your thing, and he'll do the rest. Julian Berman for WIRED A few days after the Kayla-inspired shoot with Tsui, Schneider is back in the same downtown LA studio, shooting with Austin Percario, a 20-year-old singer. Today's song is the James Bay ballad ""Let it Go."" Schneider's given himself the task playing piano and tambourine simultaneously, and he's sitting on the bench trying to work out the rhythm. Normally, Schneider has singers just sing--""It makes my life easier,"" he says, ""in that I only have to worry about me doing all the random things""--but today, he's assigned Percario the job of violently hitting the bass drum during the song's emotional ending. Percario's nervous about it. He listens to the track over and over, playing air drums to get the beat just right, nodding in time with the click in the audio. After a few full rehearsals, he and Schneider are both satisfied they've got it down. While Percario checks his hair, Schneider throws on his vest and checks the lighting for approximately the 93rd time. Then he jogs over to the stereo to restart the track on his iPhone, and they start shooting. Like many of Schneider's collaborators, Percario came to him. After auditioning for American Idol and the X Factor, Percario was desperate to do more music. ""I emailed his dad like four times before I got a response,"" Percario tells me. He's worked with Schneider a couple of times now, and he's finally getting over the awkwardness of singing into a camera over a track of your own voice. The drum part is the most Schneider's ever asked him to do, and once Percario gets the hang of it he gets way into it. All things considered, this shoot isn't terribly complex. It's not a one-take, it doesn't involve segways or complicated dance routines. It's just Schneider and Percario. The whole thing only takes about two hours, and maybe a half-dozen plays of ""Let it Go."" When they finish, Manny Figs, Schneider's cameraman and only full-time employee, heads home to do a first pass on the edit. Once he's done, Schneider will spend the next few weeks tweaking and perfecting. For now, Schneider gets back into his car, which has a harp in the back he's teaching himself how to play, and heads home. He has more videos to work on, more songs to learn and write, more potential collaborators to vet. In the room next to his home studio, he's set up a new instrument, a series of carefully carved bamboo tubes called an angklung. A fan gave it to him, and he wants to use it in a video. He has no idea how to play it, of course, but that's no problem. He'll figure it out. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

It's just what he does. But how difficult would this actually be? Yes, I know Captain America is just a comic book hero, but that doesn't mean this won't be a fun physics problem. How do you model a thrown shield reflecting off different surfaces? Really, that's the difficult part. Let me go ahead and start with some assumptions. The speed of the shield doesn't matter. I will assume it ""flies"" like an airplane wing so it will follow a level trajectory and not drop as it travels. In the comic books, the shield is made from vibranium. Let's assume this allows perfectly elastic collisions with different surfaces. As I showed before, a completely elastic collision can obey the ""law of reflection"". This means that when the shield hits a wall, the angle of incidence will be equal to the angle of reflection. I think that's enough to start making a model. It's not difficult to make a shield move at a constant speed, but the reflection off a wall isn't so straightforward. Here's three questions you have to ask: Does the shield even hit the wall? When and where is the collision with the wall? What is the reflected velocity vector given the orientation of the wall and the incoming velocity? Yes, it would be fairly easy to model this in the case of a wall that is only in the y-direction (up/down), but I want a more generic reflection. First, how do we know if there is a collision? There are several methods for collision detection (it's an important part of many video games) but I want to create my own. Suppose I have a wall with a length of L, oriented in some direction, and a shield moving toward it. The first thing I am going to do is to find the position of the two end points for the wall (P1 and P2). Now I can calculate the distance from P1 and P2 to the position of the shield. If the shield is intersecting this wall, the sum of these distances should equal L. Here is a diagram: If I calculate these distances as vectors, the sum of the magnitudes of r1 and r2 (from P1 and P2 to the shield) will only equal L if the center of the shield is between the two points. If the shield is outside the points or not yet to the wall, their sum will exceed L. A couple of things to notice. First, I am just dealing with this wall in 2-D, but this method should work in 3-D. Second, I don't care about the size of the shield--I am merely dealing with it as a point object. I don't think this matters for playing with collisions with a wall (we could change this later if it bothers you). Now for the reflection. This is trickier and my method only works in 2-D so the shield moves in the x-y plane. If I create a wall in VPython (Glowscript), there are some properties of this object which is technically a ""box."" There is the position of the center of the box, the size of the box and the ""axis."" The axis is a vector that is perpendicular to the box to describe its orientation. Here is a diagram showing the shield colliding with the wall. The two important vectors are the velocity and the axis. Here I have a as the angle between the incident velocity vector and the axis vector. You can find this angle by first finding the dot product between these two vectors and using the following relationship: Finding the dot product for vectors is simple if you know the vector in component form (the x,y,z components). It's also simple to find the magnitude of these vectors. So, in the end you get the angle between these two vectors. Oh, it's even easier since both the dot product (dot) and the vector magnitude (mag) are built in functions in VPython. But what I really need is the angle th which shows the amount I would have to rotate the original vector. Based on my drawing, this vector th would be: Now that I have the rotation angle, I need to rotate the vector. I can use the rotation matrix in 2-D. Here is the xkcd version of the rotation matrix. It's funnier than the actual matrix. So, that's pretty simple. Now let's put it all together. Actually, this is sort of like a video game. So I made a video game. Just drag the arrow to pick the direction you wish to aim the shield. The goal is to bounce the shield off the wall and hit the blue circle. If you successfully hit the circle, it turns yellow. If you miss, just press play and try again. The code is a little messy--but you can check it out here. I'll probably make a screencast in which I go over the different parts of this program. Once you play with this program, you might notice it's not so trivial to aim at the wall and hit the target. You can do it, but only with a little bit of guesswork. How about something a bit more complicated? What if the reflected surface isn't a flat wall but a curved surface? In this case we can still assume that the incident and reflected angle are still equal. However, there is a big difference. Now if you hit the curved surface at a slightly different point, it will have a different axis about which it will reflect. In terms of coding, it's actually an easier program to create. Collision detection is simpler. All I need to do is determine the distance from the center of the curved wall to the center of the shield. If this distance is less than the sum of their radii, then they ""hit."" After that, I merely need to calculate the vector that is equivalent to the axis vector for the wall. There is one problem that I encountered--depending on where the shield hits, it could reflect either to the left or the right. By finding the angle between the incident velocity vector and the ""axis"" I can determine the direction of rotation in the rotation matrix. Here is the same ""game"" with a curved surface. (the code) Pretty tough, right? Of course Captain America is better than all of you at this. He can bounce his shield off multiple surfaces and score a ""hit."" Are you ready to try two bounces? Try to hit the curved surface and then the wall and then target. Here is the code. If you score a hit on your first try, you should be an Avenger. And if you want some homework, here are a few suggestions. Make a plot of initial velocity angle vs. deflected angle. How does this plot look for both the flat and curved wall? You might prefer to make a plot of initial angle vs. final y-position or something. What if you put in a third object to deflect the shield? Is it even solvable? Can you make the computer program find an angle that would score a hit? What about non-elastic collisions? Yes, that would be a little bit more difficult--but still fun. Go Back to Top.

It had been four years since he'd graduated from high school with hopes of attending a four-year college. But year after year, at school after school, his applications were rejected. Four years on, just as his high school friends were preparing to graduate from college, their whole lives seemingly ahead of them, Casas was languishing. ""They were like, 'But you were such a good student in high school,'"" Casas remembers his friends saying. The truth was, Casas knew why he couldn't get into school, but he also knew he couldn't tell his friends. To tell anyone the truth--that he was an undocumented immigrant, a secret he kept for 13 long years--was to risk being taken away from his family, his friends, and the only home he'd known since his parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was 8. Related Stories Even Conservatives Say Trump's Immigration Plan Is Dystopian Zuckerberg-backed Site: Immigration Stance Could Doom GOP Tech Giants Back Immigrants In Upcoming Supreme Court Fight ""I got really sad and depressed,"" he says. ""You stop thinking of yourself as a human being, and you start thinking of yourself as a number."" The second time Casas considered suicide was last February after a Texas court blocked President Obama's expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama's executive order would have allowed people like Casas who came to the US as children to get a work permit and exemption from deportation. Casas was now 35, and thanks to the kindness of one admissions officer, he had eventually received a bachelor's degree and MBA from the University of Maryland. Still, without a work permit, the only job Casas could find, even with his degrees, was as a personal trainer. DACA, he believed, would be his ticket to the career he'd worked so long and hard for. ""Once DACA got shut down I was like, 'I'm out of options. There's nothing left,"" Casas says. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. It was risky, Casas knew, but it wasn't unheard of. Starting in 2010, an intrepid group of young undocumented immigrants in Chicago launched the Coming Out of the Shadows campaign. They uploaded videos to YouTube, telling the world that they were undocumented. Since then, thousands more videos have landed on YouTube. Undocumented people have created page after page on Facebook. They've used the hashtag #UndocumentedandUnafraid to band together and share their stories on Twitter. And advocacy groups like Define American have sprouted up with the explicit purpose of getting undocumented people and their allies to reshape their own narrative using the tools of the Internet. Then he realized there was one option: He could come out. He could tell his story. Casas decided it was time to join this movement. So he reached out to Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and founder of Define American. Vargas came out as undocumented in the pages of The New York Times Magazine in 2011 and in the process became perhaps the most public face of the undocumented community. Like Casas, Vargas knows all too well what it's like to carry the weight of isolation for so long. He had never even met another undocumented person his age until he was 28. ""I found out I was undocumented in 1997, and it was like, you couldn't Google it,"" Vargas says. ""There was no social networking to be done. So it just goes inside of you. You internalize it. It eats you up and grows into this kind of tumor in a way."" It's no wonder, then, that mounting research is finding that undocumented youths and the children of undocumented immigrants often suffer, like Casas, with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. But the connective powers--and relative anonymity--of the Internet are starting to break down these walls of secrecy, finally enabling undocumented people to find each other and remind each other that they're not as alone as they think they are. ""I would argue this is the first civil rights movement that has grown up in social media,"" says Vargas, who launched Define American's Coming Out campaign last summer. Telling the World Just as important as telling these stories to one another is sharing these stories with the world, say members of the coming-out movement. That's particularly true in an election cycle in which presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has tried to cast undocumented immigrants as a blight on the country. Trump has famously promised to deport the estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a threat one might expect would dissuade people like Casas from coming out. Instead, he says, it's motivated him. ""I thought, what if I told the world: 'Hey America, this is what an undocumented immigrant looks like, and by the way, we're not rapists,'"" Casas says. ""I'm at a point in my life where it's like, help me or deport me. Don't leave me in limbo."" The connective powers and relative anonymity of the Internet are starting to break down walls of secrecy. Casas isn't the only one who's been compelled to speak out in the era of Trump. Thomas Kim, a law student at Arizona State University, also recently reached out to Define American to discuss how he could safely come out. ""The conversation about immigration got more hostile and more harsh,"" Kim says. ""I wanted to break the stereotypes that undocumented students are lazy, and they don't speak English."" On a surface level, it seems, people like Casas, Vargas, and Kim are putting themselves at risk. And yet many have found that by speaking out, they become part of a network that can protect them in the long run. ""It's sort of like a safety network,"" says Erika Andiola, an undocumented immigrant who came to the US from Mexico when she was 11. Andiola began working as an immigrant rights organizer in 2008, after Arizona passed a law that banned undocumented immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. By 2013, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided her home in Arizona, taking her mother and brother with them, Andiola's online network was already vast. ""My first reaction was: 'I'm going to put it on YouTube and let people know,'"" Andiola remembers. ""These types of things happen everyday. Raids. Deportations, but nobody talks about it."" The Power of Sharing The video, which features a sobbing Andiola moments after the raid, received 60,000 views within 12 hours. It included a phone number for ICE that people could call to demand Andiola's family be returned to Arizona. And it worked. The following day, her family members were released, and Andiola wrote the following message on Facebook: ""My mom was on [her] way to Mexico. She said the driver turned around when she received a call. She was really confused, than they told her that the reason why she was returning was because her daughter was mobilizing the whole country to get her to come back. The reality is, you all made it happen!"" Now, as Bernie Sanders' national press secretary for Latino outreach, Andiola regularly tells that story in front of crowds of thousands. 'No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts.' Of course, not everyone's coming out story has a happy ending. Last November, in an essay published in The Huffington Post, Casas told the world he was undocumented. The next day, he wrote a lengthy Facebook post about it and later went on to upload a video of himself telling his story on YouTube. But while these messages make Casas appear defiant, he says, ""my life has gotten so much harder."" Over the last year, Casas, who is still a personal trainer, says exposing his legal status has cost him income, several clients, and a few friendships. There were the anonymous attacks, too. ""No matter how prepared you are, when you read people calling you an invader, it hurts,"" he says. And yet, Casas says he doesn't regret his decision to come out. ""Sharing my story and hearing how people felt about me, I gained the most incredible gift I could imagine,"" he says. Recently, he's begun volunteering with undocumented kids in his area, because he says, ""I would have killed to know someone like me when I was 18."" Still, he says there are plenty of days he considers getting in his car, driving to the border, and self-deporting. But there's one thing that stops him, he says: ""I know these kids are watching me."" Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 immigration Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Thousands of front-office types, journalists, and fans flitted from talk to talk, listening to experts expound on everything from biometrics to eSports to contract negotiations. But basketball shot-chart maven Kirk Goldsberry's breezy, finger-on-the-pulse consideration of the state of the three-point shot was the hot ticket, with people spilling out of the room into the hallway. Some of that popularity stemmed from the title of Goldberry's presentation: The Curry Landscape. It referred, of course, to Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors. Curry enjoyed a career-best regular season that dwarfed last year's amazing run, sinking 402 threes--obliterating his previous record, set last year, of 286--and winning a second consecutive league MVP. Curry is the face of the hot-button topic in pro hoops: the prevalence of three-point shooting, and how basketball bears little resemblance to the game James Naismith invented in 1891 when he nailed peach baskets above the doors of a gymnasium in Springfield, Massachusetts. Curry is the best three-point shooter ever, a player so prolific that he often leaves traditional defenses scrambling and opposing offenses struggling to keep up. Although Curry and the Warriors are simply exploiting his freakish talent, their radically different style of play has brought calls for change. Some even suggest introducing a four-point shot, an idea some hall-of-famers find intriguing. Goldsberry isn't quite so radical. He just wants to look at the data, and consider the options it presents. ""We can use analytics in a new regulatory capacity to monitor the game and make decisions like where the three-point line should be in an informed manner,"" he says. Curry shoots a three-point basket over DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers at the ORACLE Arena in Oakland on March 23, 2016.Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Move Back the Line The NBA adopted the three-point line in 1979, creating an arc 23 feet, 9 inches from the basket at the top of the key, tapering to 22 feet at the baseline. Once considered a gimmick (Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach hated the idea until he drafted a young sharpshooter named Larry Bird), the three has become an integral part of the game. Players attempted almost 13 threes per game during the 1997 season; that figure almost doubled to 24 last season. To illustrate this change, Goldsberry compared Cleveland Cavaliers' forward Kevin Love's shot selection during his rookie season in 2008 and last season. Over time, Love went from being a post player who stayed close to the rim to being a perimeter player averaging almost as many three-point attempts as Reggie Miller, one of the best three-point shooters ever. More WIRED Sports Mark McClusky Techies Are Trying to Turn the NBA Into the World's Biggest Sports League K.M. McFarland 8 Key Moments in the NBA's Quest For World Domination Nick Stockton The Mind-Bending Physics of a Tennis Ball's Spin Given the sharp rise in threes, Goldsberry's suggestion to move the three-point line back seems logical. That would lower the odds of a player sinking the shot, and therefore lower the odds he'd take it. People who dislike this idea tend to argue it is unprecedented. That's not true. For three seasons between 1994-97, during the Chicago Bulls second championship three-peat, the NBA shortened the line to a uniform 22 feet all the way around the basket. Three-point shooting spiked, and the league eventually abandoned the idea. The most intriguing option would be adjusting the line each season, choosing a distance that would yield a field goal percentage of around 33 percent, which is about how many threes players made when the league introduced the shot. Golf course designers do this, using pin placement and terrain to maintain a par of 72 strokes over 18 holes. Alternatively, the league could move the line back permanently. But this creates a problem: It would change the dimensions of the court, which is 50 feet wide and 94 feet long, if you want to keep the 3-point corner shot. That, in turn, would require remodeling many billion-dollar arenas--something Goldsberry concedes probably won't happen. Take A Cue From Baseball Stadiums Goldsberry's most radical suggestion is letting each team paint the line where it sees fit, within reason. ""People have honestly told me this is the stupidest thing I've ever said,"" he says. Major League Baseball does this, though. The distance to the outfield wall varies with each ballpark, significantly impacting the chance of a home run. The official rules of Major League Baseball state, ""A distance of 320 feet or more along the foul lines, and 400 feet or more to center field is preferable."" That provides wide latitude and contributes to the personality of places like AT&T Park in San Francisco or Wrigley Field in Chicago. It accounts for how managers set rosters to take advantage of the unique geometry in a home stadium. The NBA already allows teams to alter uniforms and chose how they paint the court, Goldsberry argues. Why not let them create a home-court advantage in which each team is familiar with the line at home, but constantly adjusting on the road? ""I think it would be interesting to consider what the NBA would look like if there was a 36-foot line in Indiana and a 22-foot line in some other place,"" said Goldsberry. Such an approach would see teams draw a line that suits their roster while combating opponents' strengths. The Warriors could set the line further back and capitalize on its sharpshooting, for example, while the Miami Heat--who made 1,112 fewer attempts this season--could move the line in, increasing their odds of sinking threes. Do Nothing Or the league could do nothing, a point Goldsberry illustrated with one last beautiful chart that showed the assist rate per successful field goal in a recent season. The data revealed that most spots from which players scored after receiving a pass were beyond the three-point line. This is, essentially, an aesthetic argument that poses a simple question: Is the game better when dominant centers, who won 19 of 20 league MVPs before the advent of the three-point line, keep possessions close to the basket? Or is it better when players are passing the ball and the action is further from the hoop? In other words, is the dynamic, exciting gameplay of the Warriors so beautiful to behold as to warrant doing nothing? During the regular season that just ended, Curry landed more threes than Magic Johnson did during his 13 seasons (which, coincidentally, started the same year the NBA introduced the three-point line). More threes means more baskets made after assists, which was Johnson's defining statistic. He remains beloved for his generosity with the ball, helping his team play at its best. The three-pointer, once considered a gimmick, is integral to the game. Curry and the Warriors have pushed this to an extreme. People can debate whether this is a problem, and how to address it. But the best thing to do might be to simply sit back and enjoy the beautiful passes and arcing splashdowns into the hoop.

Despite appearances, our icy neighbor to the north is 1.5 times smaller than India, more than four times smaller than the United States, and 14.5 times smaller than Africa. In fact, Greenland is about the size of Saudi Arabia, though you'd never guess it by looking at the world's most ubiquitous map. The Mercator projection is an inherently flawed design. It exaggerates the size of countries closest to the poles while depicting size most faithfully at the equator. Though it was once a handy navigational tool for sailors, the map has instilled in the rest of us a gross misunderstanding of geography and relative country size. For the perspective-challenged among us, there's hope yet. A new web app called The True Size Of is an interactive map that its creators, James Talmage and Damon Maneice, hope will give people a better understanding of a country's true size. Dragging one country across the map causes it to change size and shape in real time, allowing you to place it beside countries at other latitudes and compare their relative sizes. For example, as you overlay the United States on top of Greenland, the former stretches and bloats. Meanwhile, dragging Greenland down toward Saudi Arabia, causes the northerly country to shrink dramatically in size. For even more accuracy, you can use a compass in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen to rotate each country for alignment. It's a simple tool, but it's wildly effective at granting a new perspective on the size and shape of the world's various land masses. As we all know from years of staring at maps that tell us otherwise, that kind of perspective is pretty hard to come by. You can play with the map here. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

For his master's thesis, Choi, who recently graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven, created benches and stools that lay flat but pop open. He calls it De-dimension, and it's flatpack with a perceptual twist: a perspective drawing come to life, its planar form conveying the height, width, and depth of the ""assembled"" stool. In the video, Choi pulls one from the wall and, with a smooth, quick gesture, opens it like the page of a pop-up book.

""If our perception of an object is not different on a plane image and an actual subject,"" he asks, ""isn't it possible to substitute the two with each other?"" In the case of De-Dimension, the stools and benches are never truly 2-D; but the fact our brains can appreciate their dimensionality, even when flat, is a clever visual trick that would earn Choi an awful lot of money if he decides to sell his designs.

The rise of machine learning has made artificial neural networks--the computer programs that facilitate that learning--a common topic of conversation. Google, Facebook, and most other big players in the tech industry are investing heavily in them. News articles about artificial intelligence (including ours) are littered with references to neural networks. Still, getting inundated with an idea doesn't mean you understand it. Daniel Smilkov, a member of Google's Big Picture Research Group, and Shan Carter, who creates interactive graphics for The New York Times, decided to make the concept more easily digestible. They collaborated to create this interactive data-visualization that lets users toy around with and design their own neural network. It's not quite kindergarten for neural networks; you need to have a grasp on notions like inputs, regularization, and ratio train data going into what Smilkov and Carter call their ""playground.""

Venngage, the company that lets you make infographics with the click of (a few) buttons, recently launched a new product called Beam. Beam does for charts what Venngage does for infographics as a whole. Which is to say, it makes the process of transforming data into useful visuals very, very easy. Beam is built on a template. Swap out the default text and data for your own, and you've got the bones of a chart. The web tool comes with four chart options--pie, bar, column, and line--and a handful of formatting choices. If we're being real, the variety isn't Earth-shatteringly cool. It would be a lot more fun if you could choose your own color scheme as opposed to Beam's pre-packaged swatches, for example. But what the tool lacks in choice it makes up for in efficiency. Beam holds your hand through the entire process. Embedding the chart is a matter of copy and pasting a link, and Beam makes it super easy to share on social media. It's clear that Beam is trying to be the go-to chart design tool for the Instagram set (the company said so itself!).

To celebrate, we've compiled a list of the company's 15 most pivotal products, starting with the design of the iPhone and ending with the San Bernardino iPhone. But to see all of Apple's products from the past four decades, at once, look to ""The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0"" ($90)--a comprehensive visual overview of Apple's oeuvre, from the folks at Pop Charts Lab. The Brooklyn infographic-makers created the original chart in 2011, when the iPad 2 was the latest innovation. Now, they've updated it to include everything up to the iPhone SE and 9.7"" iPad Pro, both of which were added to Apple's lineup after the recent Apple event in Cupertino. The updated poster, like the original, is organized by year and device category (software, all-in-ones, handhelds, and so on). You can watch as Apple shrinks from the bulky Lisa to the Apple Watch, but you can also see, quite clearly, the impact of Steve Jobs' return to the company, in 1997. The y-axis of ""The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0"" shows the year, and the top half of the chart is a cluster of tiny icons. Toward the poster's bottom half (which chart's the period after Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs returned), the data visualization becomes sparser. Apple rolled out the bulbous, colorful iMac, the iBook, and, a few years later, the iPod. The trend toward fewer offerings reflects a shift in Apple's strategy: Rather than asking consumers to choose between a slew of options, Apple would choose for them. The post-Jobs years have followed that trend, with the exception of the handheld category, where options remains an important selling point. You can see it spelled out in the data, on the bottom-righthand corner of the poster: it's a swarm of gadgets, in a range of sizes. Go Back to Top.

Now, a national referendum has put the idea to rest: New Zealand will keep the Blue Ensign it's used since 1902. In keeping the venerable banner, New Zealanders rejected the Silver Fern, designed by architect Kyle Lockwood of Auckland. His design kept the current flag's four red stars but replaced the Union Jack a silver fern frond as its primary motif. The silver fern is a familiar symbol throughout the country, one used by the All Blacks rugby team and a few official tourism campaigns. #NZ flag results https://t.co/vljBZKoQjY pic.twitter.com/nzU9fzPUuW -- nzherald (@nzherald) March 24, 2016 Of the votes cast, 56.6 percent were in favor of keeping the current flag, and 43.2 percent favored the fern. Prime Minister John Key, a vocal advocate for this campaign, which cost New Zealand a reported $26 million, told reporters he would not revisit the topic. After the government announced in October, 2014, that it would consider exploring a new flag, thousands of aspiring designers submitted ideas. Many can only be described as batshit insane, and we'll let John Oliver tell you about them. But there were plenty of good designs, according to the rules of vexillology, and the Silver Fern was among them. It's simple enough to remember, but its meaning is unique to New Zealand: local lore traces the fern's origins to the Maori, the country's indigenous Polynesian population. Adopting it in place of the Union Jack icon would have symbolically divorced New Zealand's flag from that of Australia and the United Kingdom. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Those are the directions for The Most Dangerous Writing App, a brutal new web tool designed to help you get over your writer's block. The app is the work of Manuel Ebert, who describes himself on Twitter as a ""Ex-neuroscientist, data wrangler, designer, and engineer."" He's also a founding partner of Summer.ai, a small data consultancy agency. Ebert made The Most Dangerous Writing App on his own time, and released it for free. There are lots of tricks for overcoming writer's block. One of the most commonly prescribed bits of advice is perhaps the most obvious: just write. That could mean banging out a rough draft in one fell swoop, or it could mean pretending like you're writing in a diary, letting out a stream of consciousness. Or, as editors love to say, ""just pretend you're at a bar, having a beer, talking to your friend."" The Most Dangerous Writing App The goal of all these strategies is to force you to get over your ego. Stop waiting for a romantic surge of inspiration and just write. The Most Dangerous Writing App doesn't care what technique you use, provided you keep typing. If you stop, even for a second, the edges of the screen become tinged with red. The longer you go without typing, the redder the edges become, until, after five seconds of inactivity, your progress is unceremoniously erased. Forever. While writing this I somewhat predictably experienced a small bout of writer's block, so I gave the app a try. The interface is a clean, no-nonsense text editor. You'll find nothing in the way of formatting tools; if it wasn't already abundantly clear, the app is purpose-built for writing and writing only. It allows for plenty of backspacing and typo-correcting, both of which can be useful for procrastinating in micro-doses, but I mostly felt compelled to write. Somewhere towards the tail end of my five minutes (you can choose to write nonstop for five, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes, if you're a masochist) the pressure starts to set in, and I'm really rambling. The UX is cleverly conceived, if a bit stressful at first (my heart rate went up while I was using it). The Most Dangerous Writing App But then, that imposed sense of urgency is the whole point. If you're someone who thrives under pressure, or feels most productive when you're working at the eleventh hour, the Most Dangerous Writing App could be a good way for you to apply that pressure, artificially. And for the record, it did get me over my writer's block. You're reading this article now, aren't you? Go Back to Top.

Letters are easy enough--we learn the alphabet as children and then cease to consciously notice them as time goes on--but typography, the art of crafting the written language, is a tricky business. Typographers create fonts in type design software, where letters are mapped with a series of coordinates. By tweaking each vector a millimeter here, and a hair there, designers can create the kind of expressiveness that differentiates Baskerville from, say, Courier. Both are serif typefaces, but they feel extraordinarily different. ""The Taxonomy of Typography,"" a new print from the Pop Chart Lab poster-makers, explains the typographer's palette. Painters have colors; typographers have neo-grotesque type, ascenders, and letter-spacing. Like a periodic table of type elements, the chart explains typography by breaking down varieties of type, letter anatomy, measurements and spacing, and typesetting. Whether you're a type neophyte or a seasoned designer, it's a handy chart. You can snag one through Pop Chart Lab's pre-order sale, for $29, here. Pop Chart Lab Go Back to Top.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Data Visualization design thinking Typography Adam Calhoun Punctuation is having a moment. There was this book. Then these posters. Now, there's yet another set of visualizations that looks at the unsung heroes of literature. Inspired by Nicholas Rougeux's ""Between The Words"" posters, scientist Adam Calhoun decided to put his own spin on punctuation as visualization. Calhoun was curious to see how the punctuation in his favorite books stacked up, so he wrote a script that strips the words from the pages. Next to Rougeux's swirling posters, Calhoun's visualizations are less abstract, more straightforward. In one, he simply leaves them as-is--a block of periods, commas and dashes in all their geometric, grammatical beauty. In another, he assigns each glyph a color, creating glowing heatmaps that show which marks are most prevalent. Calhoun takes it one step further by breaking down the data into digestible bar charts that show words per punctuation mark, words per sentence, and overall use of punctuation. Unsurprisingly, Earnest Hemmingway's ""A Farewell to Arms""  is lacking in punctuational flourishes, relying only on periods and quotations to fill out the author's stark writing style. William Faulkner, on the other hand, wasn't afraid of a wordy sentence and a semicolon or ten. It's hard to say what's behind the recent spike in interest in punctuation. For Calhoun, the intrigue seems to lie in the unspoken impact punctuation has on an author's writing. For others, it might be that the glyphs, themselves, are admiration-worthy pieces of design. Either way, it's clearly a good time to be a word nerd. Adam Calhoun Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Books charts Data Visualization punctuation Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Kyu is part of Tokyo's Hakuhodo DY Holdings, and includes other agencies like Sid Lee, Red Peak Group, and Digital Kitchen. The dollar value of the partial acquisition, and the fraction of Ideo's business that it constitutes, have not been made public. In a post on Medium, Ideo's CEO Tim Brown explains: The rate of change has been dizzying, and today's advanced technologies -- AI, genomics, robotics, data science, the Internet of Things -- have so outpaced our industrial-era organizations and infrastructure, they end up hitting institutional cul-de-sacs. The technologies don't come to a halt, of course, they simply move on, seeking out other places where they race ahead. If our institutions are to survive, they'll have to create new roadways. That's a design problem -- one that requires new rules of engagement with a broad set of collaborators. We're excited to have found those collaborators in a few like-minded design firms. In the same post, Brown quickly dismisses the idea that Ideo is ""caught in the much ballyhooed death spiral of the independent design firm."" Instead, he says the decision to sell a stake in Ideo's business and join a collective is part of a larger mission to ""apply our collective design practice to greater challenges."" Whatever the reason, the business deal fits the larger trend of big firms buying up smaller design studios. McKinsey bought Lunar; Yves Behar sold a majority stake in fuseproject to the Chinese holding company BlueFocus. In many ways, these transitions aren't new. There's a long history of commingling between design and business (more on that here). Ideo is just the latest--and most high-profile--firm to make such a move. Go Back to Top.

The pouring paint can. The happy Mac. Susan Kare designed them all. In creating these and most of the other icons on the original Apple Macintosh, she established the visual language that would form the foundation of point-and-click computing.  Here, Kare, icon of icons, talks about the creative decisions behind some of the best-loved symbols of the past four decades. Kare delivered this presentation at last year's Layers Design Conference in San Francisco, but the video was only recently posted online. It's full of fresh observations about the creative process, insights about her time at Apple, and advice for designing with accessibility in mind; so even if you're familiar with Kare and her work, we're willing to bet you'll find something new here. We knew from Kare's 2013 book, for example, that the command icon ([?]) was originally a symbol used to denote interesting features at Swedish campgrounds, but the story of how she stumbled upon the symbol in the first place, and how she weighed its merits at the time, was new to us. (Her description of her first trip to Sweden, decades after she copped the command icon for Apple, is also pretty damn charming.)   Her talk's about half an hour long and well worth watching in its entirety. The second half of the video, a Q&A between Kare and Daring Fireball's John Gruber, is also worth a watch. Go Back to Top.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Mattel Barbie just got a redesign. The iconic doll now comes in four different sizes: petite, tall, curvy, and original. You know the original size--it's the one that, if Barbie were a life-size human woman, would leave her with a 16-inch waist and an inability to walk on her own two feet. It's also the size that's outraged critiques for years, prompting Mattel to make a radical design move. That move was unveiled this morning, in a TIME magazine cover story. The TIME story covers the business and design choices that went into launching the new Barbie body styles, but it also sheds some light on the origins of Barbie's unattainable figure: Barbie has courted controversy since her birth. Her creator, Ruth Handler, based Barbie's body on a German doll called Lilli, a prostitute gag gift handed out at bachelor parties. Her proportions were designed accordingly. When Handler introduced Barbie (named after her daughter Barbara) in 1959 at the New York Toy Fair, her male competitors laughed her out of the room: nobody, they insisted, would want to play with a doll with breasts. Still, Barbie's sales took off, but by 1963 women were protesting the same body men had ridiculed. That year, a teen Barbie was sold with a diet book that recommended simply, ""Don't eat."" When a Barbie with pre-programmed phrases uttered, ""Math class is tough,"" a group called the Barbie Liberation Organization said the doll taught girls that it was more important to be pretty than smart. The new sizing lexicon is deliberately neutral, but in plain English it means that in addition to the original doll you can now buy a short Barbie, a tall Barbie, or a Barbie with hips, thighs, and a hint of meat on her bones. It's this last one--curvy Barbie--that is the real game changer, and the one that's stirring up reactions. They are, of course, mixed: So love this! ABOUT TIME!

The building, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is a wonder to wander through, with its soaring atrium and gleaming, spiraled ramps. It's a museum best experienced in person, of course--but for those of who can't make it in the flesh, good news: You can now visit through your computer. Following museums like the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate in London, the Guggenheim is the latest addition to Google's expanding Cultural Institute project, which has digitized more than 32,000 pieces of artwork from more than 150 museums around the world since 2011. Using Google's Street View technology, digital visitors can now explore Wright's building, ascending and descending its ramp with a digital pair of feet. More than 120 artworks have also been digitized and made available online. The museum explains it was quite the challenge to capture the essence of the building, given its unique architecture. Apparently, it took a fleet of drone, tripod, and street view trolley cameras to get the shots that were then stitched together for a 360-degree view. We have to admit that, while it's way cooler to see see the museum IRL, the circularity of the Guggenheim does lend itself quite nicely to the 360 experience. Go Back to Top.

More accurately, it translates to, that profoundly content feeling you get when it's frigid outside but you're inside wearing flannel and drinking hot toddies in front of a fire. Hygge, pronounced ""hoo-gah,"" is a bit of a polysemy. It's derived from the Norwegian word for ""well-being,"" and you can feel hygge, be hygge, or do hygge. Denmark's official tourism website has a page called ""The art of Danish hygge,"" which explains that hygge high season starts at Christmas, ""when Danes pull out all the hygge stops,"" but reassures you that you can still experience hygge in the summer. ""Picnics in the park, barbeques with friends, outdoor concerts, street festivals and bike rides can all be very hygge."" According to the BBC, hygge is even a course subject at Morley College in London. Hygge is also the best way to explain the principles of Scandinavian design. Think of it like an aesthetic adaptation to the harsh winters there; when it's below freezing and dark for 16 hours a day, making your indoor environment warm and welcoming is imperative. As Fredrik Carlstrom, the founder of a Scandinavian design studio called Austere, put it to me (in a separate interview), ""Scandinavian design isn't austere. It's what is outside that's austere and it makes our homes really nice."" It's why furniture and lighting from that part of the world is of such high caliber. If you're not yet hip to hygge, now might be a good time to embrace the Danish attitude towards the cold. Menacing news reports of the ""crippling"" and ""deadly"" blizzard that's headed for the east coast will remind you to stock up on bottled water and batteries. (And you should, we're not here to be flippant about potentially dangerous storms). But hygge, aptly described by this travel website as, ""the art of creating intimacy,"" might help you pull through, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The withheld payment has to do with copyrights over Hadid's design. The Japan Sports Council wants them, and Hadid is refusing the hand them over. If she did, it would give the JSC license to use any element of her design, without any additional payment. It's a confounding request, especially in light of the JSC's very recent (and very public) decision to name Kengo Kuma as the stadium's new architect. The stadium project has been mired in trouble from the start. In 2013, Japanese designers made noise by calling Hadid's design too large, and even started a petition to halt construction. In 2014, Hadid and the JSC struggled to maintain a budget, and the cost of the stadium ballooned to a reported $2 billion. This summer, Tokyo killed it. In October, Hadid requested payment. In reply, the JSC sent documents, with the new copyright stipulations, to Hadid's office. After the JSC chose Kuma and his design for the stadium, in December, Hadid's firm issued a statement that mentions the ""remarkable similarities of our original detailed stadium layout and our seating bowl configuration with those of the design announced today."" The timing of the different events--the JSC's request to hand over copyrights in the fall, followed by Hadid's accusations about copycatting in December--would suggest that Hadid and her team believe Tokyo to be using her design, under the guise of a new architect. Kuma, of course, has denied the accusation. Unfortunately for Hadid's case, lots of stadiums are bowl-shaped, and that's a building typology that you can't protect under copyright. We recently spent some time unpacking the ins and outs of copyrighting architecture in this article, but cases such as this often boil down to a ""total look and feel test,"" in which a judge looks at two designs and asks, ""do these things look substantially similar?"" It's a flimsy rule, and if you look at Hadid's design and Kuma's, it doesn't look so good for the former. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

These remarkable hairstyles, perhaps most famously found atop the royal head of Marie Antoinette, were typically made from human, horse, or goat hair, and their voluminous height was boosted by padding and various other tools.  To solidify the style, a paste made from pig fat would be applied. Lovely. Buying a wig, one can imagine, was quite an investment in the 18th century. And indeed, a wig's material and accessories were an outright display of wealth and status. The more elaborate your hair, the more elaborate your wealth. While hardly a practical accessory, the wigs were, objectively, works of art. And so, it makes sense that an art museum has decided to pay homage to them by creating a perfect time-suck of a website.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email American Panorama For many of us, the word ""atlas"" evokes memories of tattered roadmaps stuffed into a glove compartment. And while atlases are technically just collections of maps (be they of roads, outer space, the world wide web, or the human body), the good ones also have a way of presenting a more holistic picture of the things they document. American Panorama, a cool new project from the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab, is a great example. American Panorama aims to be an internet-era update to Charles' Paullin's sweeping Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States from 1932. It recounts America's history through interactive cartography, letting users drag sliders and click on bubbles to take an even deeper dive into specific moments in history. American Panorama American Panorama comprises four maps created by design studio Stamen. And these maps have depth. Adding a layers of technology and interactivity to an otherwise daunting trove of data helps us make connections we might otherwise miss. For example, in a map that looks at the foreign-born population from 1850 to 2010, I was able to see that my ancestors' arrival to Nebraska in the 1880s coincided with the influx of Swedish immigrants at the time. Dragging the scrubber along the dateline reveals how, a century later, the foreign-born population in the state was mostly Asian (the map explains that 1980 was the first time the country's largest immigrant population was not European), and how, by 2010, European immigrants had been largely superseded by people from Latin America, Vietnam, China and Iraq. Paullin's atlas examined the country's social, economic and political history through a hyper-focused lens. The maps at American Panorama are similarly incisive, with titles like ""Forced Migration of Enslaved People from 1810-1860,"" ""Canals from 1820-1860,"" and ""Overland Trails."" That there are currently just four maps to choose from means that--unless you're a history buff--there's probably a slight barrier to entry. And, if we're being honest, these aren't perfect data visualizations. The interaction is still a little clunky, and I found myself wanting to be able to drill down even deeper into the data. Despite all that, as American Panorama develops into a full-fledged digital atlas, it's only going to become more powerful and compelling. Because as it turns out, the addition of even the simplest interactions can make it feel as though you're looking at history with a very powerful magnifying glass in hand--and that's a very cool thing.

There are certain rules, for sure, as master designer Peter Mendelsund--who has a design in this round up--has told us before. But designers can still thank Amazon and other e-outlets for this newfound liberation: because book covers often appear next to titles and the author name, designers are less beholden to promoting any kind of information hierarchy.

The rise of voice recognition technology, virtual reality as an emerging medium, and the uptick in health data are developments that we've all talked a lot about this year.

Take the ""atomization of apps,"" or the end of the standalone app. Omnipresent services are happening already--Fjord uses the example of Spotify, which exists as much on your laptop as it does in your Uber--but are likely to seep into other parts of our lives. From the paper: ""Visa is researching the commerce-connected car that pays for groceries, takeaways and fuel--literally payments (and collection) on wheels."" There's the rise in employee experience, or ""EX"", design. ""It was the fastest growing category of work at Fjord in 2015 across many industries, from banking to telecom to pharma,"" says the report.

To lure better talent from younger generations, businesses might want to pay attention to this decidedly unsexy category. There's also a section called ""For the people"" that looks at how governments are finally embracing design for social good. Some of this has to do with introducing in-house design standards, but the report highlights ways agencies can work with citizens. Consider the Mobile Justice app, made in tandem with the Black Lives Matter movement: ""The app has a simple feature allowing smartphone owners to send video footage directly to the American Civil Liberties Union--all with the simple shake of a phone.

She depicted her Republican opponent as ""temperamentally unfit"" to be President of the United States, and for proof, she pointed to Trump's Twitter feed. ""Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry but America's entire arsenal,"" Clinton said. Clinton lifted lines from Trump's own speeches, interviews, and social media accounts and used them to paint a picture of a candidate who does not have a coherent plan for the country, ""just a series of bizarre rants."" The audience in San Diego laughed as Clinton paraphrased Trump's stance on everything from war to North Korea to climate change. ""He says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or ambassadors, because he has, quote, 'a very good brain,'"" Clinton said. ""He believes climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" #NeverTweet The former Secretary of State also rightly predicted that Trump might have something to say about these barbs. ""We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table: bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets. I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now."" In fact, just moments before, Trump had done just that: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential! -- Donald J.

The speech was a sneak peek of what the general election season is bound to look like--and how it will play out online. Taking a cue from her nemesis, Clinton leaned more heavily on personal attacks, rather than policy talk, managing to steal the news cycle from Trump for the day. In the process, the Clinton campaign seems to be acknowledging that this fall, it's not just better ideas that will win the election. It's better memes. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

It's not designed to help you."" The president sounded at turns exasperated and confounded as he addressed the people of Elkhart, Indiana, a town he last visited during the throes of the recession in 2009, and which he said he chose today ""precisely because this county votes Republican."" ""If the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you who will have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class,"" Obama told the crowd before laying out what he believes the differences between those visions are. For Obama, the speech was a chance to boast about his administration's economic achievements--including the country's consistent job growth and a shrinking deficit--while bashing the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who Obama believes would derail that progress. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama took Trump to task over everything from his tax policies to immigration to trade to his ""provocative"" tweets. ""I'm not here looking for votes,"" Obama said. ""I'm here because I care deeply as a citizen about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over the last seven and a half years."" Populist POTUS Not that Obama shied away from sounding the kind of populist note that has characterized the 2016 campaign season. He called Trump's proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants ""a fantasy"" and rejected the idea that immigrants are responsible for stagnating wages in this country. Instead, he laid the blame on another popular target--corporate elites. ""Those decisions are made in the board rooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker,"" he said. He went on to frame Trump as a candidate who only has the interests of the rich at heart. He attacked Trump's plans to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, and lambasting his proposed tax plan which would provide a major tax cut to the top .1 percent of American earners. ""That will not make your lives better,"" Obama said. ""That will help people like him."" Trade-offs On trade, Obama called the idea that ""other countries are killing us on trade,"" which is a frequent Trump talking point, a myth. He argued, instead, that while trade and technological advancement have hurt certain industries, they've helped others, like agriculture and technology. He also emphasized the importance of trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership in dictating the terms of trade. ""If you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century, and they're trying, then TPP makes sure we set the rules,"" Obama said. On that point, at least, Obama was not just fighting Trump's anti-trade rhetoric. Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have publicly opposed the deal as well. With that exception, the president's talk could have easily been ripped from the stump speeches of either of the Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. On nearly every economic issue--from pay equity to labor standards to investment in infrastructure--Obama painted a doomsday scenario on the right. ""When I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention,"" Obama said. ""If we fall for a bunch of okey doke, just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.""

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Donald Trump election 2016 President Barack Obama This weekend's Nevada Democratic State Convention looked like something out of a Donald Trump rally--which is to say, it was marked by chaotic protests, violent threats, and flying projectiles. On Saturday night, Bernie Sanders' supporters reportedly revolted against the Nevada Democratic Party, accusing it of intentionally rigging the convention to favor Hillary Clinton. The fight continued throughout the weekend as aggrieved Sanders supporters deluged Nevada Democratic Chair Roberta Lange with sexist and threatening texts and voicemails. Today, the Vermont senator issued a statement condemning any instances of violence carried out by his supporters. At the same time, he denounced what he called a corrupt system within the Nevada state party. ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,"" Sanders said in a statement. But, he added: ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" At issue is the fact that though Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign has been actively organizing to win county conventions. By amassing more delegates at these county conventions, the Sanders campaign stood to cut into Clinton's delegate lead at the statewide convention. But the Nevada State Democratic Party denied credentials to 64 of Sanders' delegates, saying that they either weren't registered as Democrats or that their records couldn't be verified. In the end, six of them received credentials, but the vote still tipped in Clinton's favor. The room soon erupted in protests. Meanwhile, the chaotic scene has created waves within Sanders' massive Reddit community as well. Moderators are urging Sanders supporters to avoid the kind of language that could get them in trouble with the media. ""They're  expecting  us to act this way. If we take the bait and react violently and/or with threats of violence, we play right into their hands,"" one moderator wrote. ""Remember, what would Bernie do?"" Setting aside the issue of violence, however, it's a little ironic to see the Sanders campaign accusing the state party of rigging the contest. Sanders has often criticized party leaders for trying to subvert the will of the people. But in this case, it's Clinton who won the Nevada caucus to begin with and Sanders who's using the cryptic system of delegate math to gain the edge.

RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images Marco Rubio is mad as hell, and he's not going to take it anymore. Last night, in a Tweetstorm for the ages, the Florida Senator let loose a torrent of frustrations about what has been the most absurd election cycle in recent memory. And can you blame him? It's been a rough year for Rubio. Once thought to be the Republican party's great hope, instead he spent this election cycle being repeatedly ridiculed for his height, his urge to stay well hydrated, his possibly overactive sweat glands, and more. He not only lost his home state of Florida, but he opted not to run for re-election to the Senate. With the exception of his Marcorobot meltdown during the New Hampshire debate, the young Senator mostly retained his composure. But with just months left until he's a private citizen again, Rubio is taking a note straight from the Donald Trump playbook, and telling it like it is on Twitter. The flint to Rubio's fire last night seemed to have been a Washington Post article alleging that he is ""betwixt and between"" on his next move.

Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive may have likened his team's new arena to the Roman Colosseum, and it may be a much-needed cultural centerpiece for a city that desperately needs one, but the arena feels almost modest in its proportions. Except for what's underneath. Construction on the Golden 1 Center began in October 2014 after the city fought successfully to keep the Kings in Sacramento. Eventually Sacramento officials promised $255.5 million to the project, which Kings president Chris Granger says will be a billion-dollar project in all. And a not insignificant amount of that money is going toward building what the team hopes will be the most technologically advanced sports arena ever built. More NBA Techies Are Trying to Turn the NBA Into the World's Biggest Sports League What the NBA Knows About China That Silicon Valley Doesn't Three Ideas for Remaking the Three-Point Shot In addition to the arena, crews are bustling to build a 16-story hotel, an open mall for restaurants and shops, and a plaza on the 1.5 million-square-foot site in the dead center of the city. (If you search Google Maps, the Golden 1 Center is directly underneath the word ""Sacramento."") When it's done, the team hopes the arena will feel like not just a place for basketball but a space that's woven into the fabric of the city--not just physically, but digitally. The challenge with building tech into a project as massive and expensive as a sports arena is that tomorrow's advances become yesterday's relics. Ranadive and company have set themselves the formidable task of not only building today's most up-to-date technology into the Golden 1 Center but creating an edifice flexible enough to adapt to what the future brings. That means building an arena that doesn't just have concrete at its core. It also has code. Slide: 1 / of 6 . Caption: Sacramento Kings Slide: 2 / of 6 . Caption: Sacramento Kings Slide: 3 / of 6 .

You unlock your phone, open up the Kings app, and look for tickets. You buy them (and a parking pass) in the app, which is connected to the team's loyalty program, so you're automatically on the list for last-minute ticket upgrades. As you approach the stadium, your phone buzzes: a notification from the team telling you which lot's the easiest to park in right now. You park, walk up to the arena, scan the ticket displayed on your smartwatch and stroll through the turnstile. Your app guides you to your seat and asks if you want a hot dog or a foam finger. Attendants can bring either one to your seat in a few minutes. You're late, but that's fine; the app has replays and stats. Or you can just look up at the 84-foot (that's foot, not inch) screen that's carefully designed to make sure you can see it perfectly no matter where you are in the stadium. (Or out of the stadium--more on that in a minute.) 'Every single night, your Tesla updates. So we need to have that same philosophy when it comes to our arena.' If you would rather just watch people play basketball, says Kings CTO Ryan Montoya, that's fine. People experience games, concerts, fights, monster truck rallies, and everything else lots of different ways. But one thing's constant today: people want to stay connected. They want to send and receive texts, snaps, Instagrams, and Ellos. (Probably not so many Ellos.) The arena's job is to enable those connections. ""That's our philosophy,"" Montoya says, ""that the fans would only be limited by their own devices."" So they've run 650 miles of fiber-optic cable and 300-plus miles of copper throughout the arena, and have put hundreds of Wi-Fi access points around the building. ""A lot of systems--point of sale systems, building automation--a lot of that gets moved to Wi-Fi because it's so reliable,"" says Matt Eclavea, the team's vice president of technology. There's a 6,000-square-foot data center in the stadium. Another giant room will house a monstrous DAS (distributed antenna system) that will bring cell service to every nook and cranny of the building. The connection, the team says, will be enough to send 500,000 Snapchats per second. Which is probably enough. Sacramento Kings Eclavea and his team have tried at every turn to future-proof their system. ""A lot of thought goes into what it'll look like in five years,"" Eclavea says. ""I want to put it in now. It's a lot easier than dealing with sheet rock."" He points to two racks a few feet below the ceiling that run the length of a sparse concrete hallway underneath the seats. These are for carrying an impossible number of cables--not just now but even more years from now. When I ask how much bandwidth he expects a full house will use when the arena opens, he holds up his thumb and index finger, almost touching, and squints through them. ""Hardly any."" Eclavea says Golden 1 Center's setup has enough headroom for 10, even 20 years of innovation before anything could possibly overwhelm their network. They're working with cutting-edge Wi-Fi standards like 802.11ac, and even truly bleeding-edge ones like small cell networking. ""A lot of these things aren't even commercially available,"" Eclavea says. Given that Qualcomm chairman Paul Jacobs is an investor in the team, and that Ranadive made his fortune in software and analytics, it's not surprising that there's a constant drive toward the next thing. A fast network that never fails happens to be good for a lot more than just Instagram. Around Golden 1 Center, nearly every object--from the turnstiles that let people in the building to the lines outside the bathrooms to that 84-foot screen--is connected in some way, feeding streams of data back into the system. From a centralized command center in the bowels of the arena, a group of employees will sit at a bank of 20 or so screens and watch everything that's happening everywhere. They'll be able to redirect people to shorter concession lines, stream live video to fans' phones, and run sales on merch when t-shirts just aren't flying off the shelves. Eventually, a sufficiently fast network could even make Golden 1 Center an ideal home for new kinds of events. ""We want to be able to host e-sports, drone racing, and stuff like that,"" Montoya says, ""and for that you need a lot of bandwidth."" He mentions how he's seen Tim Cook and others botch demos because of bad Wi-Fi at press events and extends an invitation. ""They can come here and launch a product, and it'll work."" Sacramento Kings The City's Stadium Beyond the massively torrent-friendly Wi-Fi speeds, Granger seems most proud of the arena's eco-friendly initiatives. He wants to be the first-ever stadium certified LEED Platinum, the industry's highest recognition of environmental friendliness. For starters, Golden 1 Center is entirely solar-powered: panels will cover the roof, and Sacramento's 300 days of sunshine will provide 15 percent of the necessary power. The rest will come from a local solar farm. To conserve water, they're installing low-flow toilets. They're cooling the arena from underneath rather than with giant air-conditioners in the ceiling. (One nifty upside of that feature: Granger says eventually each section will be able to set its own temperature by voting in the app.) Stadium kitchens will source nearly all their food from suppliers less than 150 miles away. Don't worry, you'll be able to get nachos, they'll just be farm-to-table nachos. The Kings want to be good Sacramento citizens, creating a building that represents the people inside. Even what it means to be ""inside"" is a complicated question at Golden 1 Center. The whole facade is decorated with small holes that make the building itself feel like a canopy of trees. Giant hangar doors--made by Schweiss Doors, which made something similar for Elon Musk's SpaceX hangars--will fold up at the front of the arena so that anyone outside can see all the way in to the jumbotron. Large, angled windows jut out of the sides of the arena. ""The whole idea is anywhere you are outside, you can see inside,"" Granger says. ""And anywhere you are inside, you can see outside."" They're already talking with musicians about what it means to play a concert for the fans both inside and outside the arena. What can you do with the two 25-foot LED screens just outside the front doors? Or the nearly 600 other screens throughout the building? No one knows the answers, because no one's ever had this much tech to play with before. The Self-Updating Stadium The ""highest-tech stadium"" is an award no one ever gets to keep for long, but the Kings are definitely going to get it for a while. Before starting work on Golden 1 Center, the Kings crew toured a number of others, like nearby Levi's Stadium and Amway Arena in Orlando. Both are brand-new, highly connected arenas, and the Kings wanted to outdo both. More bandwidth, more servers, better infrastructure. They wanted a bigger screen than the 160-footer in Dallas Stadium, too, but NBA guidelines wouldn't allow it. Although, Montoya says gleefully, his is higher-res: 32 million pixels compared to 25 million in Dallas. Take that, Jerry Jones. The team still has lots of ideas, even as we walk through the construction site. The best thing about making so much of the arena's functionality dependent on software is that they can upgrade it later without needing to build anything physically new. Right now, after many years of wrangling and a few of construction, the clock's ticking on Golden 1 Center. No, there's literally a clock, ticking down to the moment Paul McCartney hits the stage on October 4th. When I first meet Montoya, he rattles off that he has 127 days left like it's the only number he can think about. That's 127 days left to build an arena that will last for decades. That will only get better over time. ""Let's look at Tesla,"" Ranadive told his team a while ago. ""Every single night, your Tesla updates. So we need to have that same philosophy when it comes to our arena: every single night, the arena updates and improves itself."" If it all works, most fans will never even think about the technology. They'll just come in, easily find their way to their seat, and enjoy the game in any low- or high-tech way they please. Then they'll go home happy, full, and foam-fingered, and Granger, Montoya, Eclavea will sleep soundly. Though they'll probably put in some more fiber first, just in case. Go Back to Top.

That doesn't mean they're not awesome, a hallmark of the day when three wheels were plenty and wood was the logical material of choice. Now, Morgan, which rediscovered its love of three wheels in 2011, steps into the future (kinda) with the EV3, a terrifically eccentric contribution to the auto industry's shift away from internal combustion engine. The British automaker says the car, introduced last year and now approaching production, is inspired by ""1930s aero-engine race cars, classic motorcycles and 1950s fantasy automatons."" The EV3 should cost around $50,000 when it goes on sale later this year. Kicking Fossil Fuels Meet Tesla's Model 3, Its Long-Awaited Car for the Masses The Electric Car Revolution Is Now Scheduled for 2022 How GM Beat Tesla to the First True Mass-Market Electric Car With a carbon fiber hood and aluminum panels laid over an ash wood frame (wood!), the EV3 is based on Morgan's standard 3-wheeler, so it still resembles an overturned bathtub. The interior is sparse but classy, with its gear switch between the speedometer and a range indicator. The single, offset headlight (it ""adds to the overall asymmetry"") sits above brass cooling fins that channel air to the 20-kilowatt hour lithium ion battery. A liquid-cooled 46-kW motor drives the rear wheel, and the range is 150 miles. It all weighs less than 1,100 pounds and tops out north of 90 mph. Yes, three-wheeled cars tend to be unstable, but Morgan doesn't cater to those concerned with practicality. The nine-second sprint to 62 mph will put you behind a Kia Sorento, but it'll feel a hell of a lot faster without a windshield. And that's what this car is all about: Giving drivers just enough performance to justify their bombastically styled three-wheeled conveyance. Related Video Uncategorized We Drive an All-Electric Ferrari, the Car that Shouldn't Exist Electric cars have a lot of promise for future cars. They're quick, quiet, and clean, but Ferrari CEO Sergio Marchionne isn't convinced. ""It's an almost obscene concept,"" he told journalists at the 2016 Geneva Auto Show. If that wasn't clear enough, he added ""you'd have to shoot me first"". But you can't stop progress, and Electric GT has taken matters into its own hands. The San Diego based company partnered with engineers EV West to convert a 1978 Ferrari 308GTS. They removed a fire damaged V8, and replaced it with 3 motors and batteries. They're calling the result a 308GTE, and claim it's more powerful and better to drive than the original. WIRED takes it for a spin--and yes, it can do donuts. Go Back to Top.

At least, that's the plan. Architecturally speaking, the Louvre is sort of screwed. The Louvre representatives wouldn't comment (they seemed busy), but a 2012 memo from Jean-Raoul Enfru, the Louvre's security and safety representative, lays out the enormity and difficulty of the problem, and the plan--based on flood levels from 1910--to deal with it. Somewhere around 86,000 square feet of storage facilities and and more than 50,000 square feet of gallery space are at risk, including the museum's entrance and auditorium beneath the famed IM Pei glass pyramid. The Islamic art department is entirely underground, putting an additional 3,000 works at risk from flooding. LAURENT KALFALA/AFP/Getty Images In a recent interview with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, Sebastien Stempfel, who oversees the Louvre's 52-member fire-fighting and emergency crew, explained the alert levels his team uses when watching the river's height. ""When the orange alert goes out, we close the water-tight doors,"" Stempfel said. ""At red level, the volunteers come in."" At that point, according to the Louvre plan, the museum has 72 hours to move up to 150,000 fragile works of art to higher ground. Of course, it'd be better if the Seine never gained admission in the first place. Hundreds of specially-trained volunteer staff will attempt to prevent water from entering the building by creating cofferdams that blockade emergency exit doors and ventilation grids. As museum workers inventory, pack, and evacuate the artwork, pumps divert water from the museum. In a video from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (above), Herve Barbaret, former deputy of the Louvre, explains the museum has plans to install four large water pumps at a cost of around 14 million euro, in addition to pumps that already regulate the water table on a daily basis. When they come online, those new pumps will collect water and send it into Paris' sewer system. In other words, now would be a great time for un cambriolage. Newer museums are building flood prevention directly into their architecture. After Hurricane Sandy, the Whitney in New York added watertight doors and waterproof glass walls. The Perez Art Museum Miami, on the waterfront and in the path of annual hurricanes, put its temperature-controlled storage facilities on an upper floor, 46 feet above sea level (well, current sea level--this is Miami). The Louvre's plan is more reactionary than preventative, and necessarily so--it's a 220-year-old building dug into the banks of a river more and more prone to flooding, thanks to climate change. And indeed, the Louvre is in the process of building a 215,000-square-foot facility in Lievin, France, to more safely warehouse its cultural treasures. But for now, the museum's staff will pack, move, and unpack thousands of works of art--and pray that the rain stops. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

You've probably heard about these rebuilders--vegan bakeries, lust-worthy watches, and so on. But a slew of new large-scale construction ideas are the works, as well, some of which are now on display at the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale. Venice Architecture Biennale ""The Architectural Imagination"" features 12 proposals, by as many architects, for four underutilized areas in Detroit. Among those proposals are models and blueprints for fairly typical industrial regeneration projects, like urban farms and shared public parks; while others, like a Detroit Reassembly Plant that would recycle material from the city's razed buildings, and a new skyscraper built from wood, from locally grown trees, confront the issue of sustainability. Our favorite display belongs to Los Angeles architect Greg Lynn, who shows off his plans for the future of the Packard Plant with a HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality headset. The 1905 factory closed in 2010 and even then wasn't fully operational. Lynn reimagines Packard as a new-age factory that manufactures robots and autonomous vehicle technology, with an online retail fulfillment center. The HoloLens view shows people and goods moving through the new facility, a useful visual aid for an architecture exhibit. To imagine the future of a building, it helps to see it in use--even if it's just in hologram form. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Architecture detroit gallery Skip Social.

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5758a140d48d080e2fde82a3"	"WIRED Binge-Watching Guide: Catastrophe | WIRED"	"Wired"	"Catastrophe is a classic boy-meets-girl story, minus the classic part. It's about a boy who meets a girl, yes, but in this version they meet, have a weeklong fling, and end up with a child. Also, they're in their 40s. Rob is a well-meaning, American ad man and recovering alcoholic who gave up booze after crapping his pants at his sister's wedding. Sharon is an often funny, sometimes cruel, Irish schoolteacher. They're both awful humans, but they're awful together. And, despite--or, perhaps, because of--all their drama and horrible behavior, they're perfect for each other. Catastrophe is about falling in love with a stranger under even stranger circumstances, and the challenge of staying in love as life throws fastballs your way.

There's a stellar supporting cast, too, including Carrie Fisher as Mia, Rob's toxic mother, and Tobias Menzies (Game of Thrones' Edmure Tully) as Sharon's doctor. While it's a critical darling, Catastrophe has still managed to fly under the radar, so it's likely you haven't gotten obsessed with it yet.

Where to Get Your Fix: Amazon Prime Best Character to Follow: Rob and Sharon are consistently the funniest characters, and Sharon's emotional storyline is one of the most compelling parts of the show's excellent second season. But Chris (Mark Bonnar), the chain-vaping, beer-chugging, Adam-Sandler-loving, quietly menacing (but secretly totally huggable) foil to Rob is hilarious. And his marriage to Fran (Ashley Jensen), which starts out as a predictable subplot about a marriage gone cold, ends up becoming delightfully twisted. It's awkward to watch, but also quite funny. Seasons/Episodes You Can Skip: There are so few episodes here, it's smart just to go ahead and watch them all. But if you truly want to race through and only watch the highlights, here are the episodes that fall short. Season 1: Episode 2 This episode is important for meeting some characters, such as Rob's mom and his drug-addled friend Dave (Daniel Lapaine), plus Sharon's empty-eyed, manic brother Fergal (Jonathan Forbes). (""I've already invested in them, they have braces and stuff now,"" he says when Sharon asks if he's getting rid of his kids after he questions if she'll get an abortion. ""They're worth money."") But parts of the episode feel more exhausting than charming, particularly when Rob struggles to re-propose to Sharon. Feel free to jump ahead. Season 1: Episode 3 Sharon has an awkward encounter and, later, dinner with an ex, who happens to be in a relationship with a woman who writes a famous Game of Thrones-like series of books. Sharon reveals that she has aspirations to write and has a very short-lived flirtation with taking the plunge into a creative life. While there's some foreshadowing here about Sharon's expectations for herself and how deception is a factor in her relationships, it all feels a little random this early in the series. Seasons/Episodes You Can't Skip: Season 1: Episode 1 Rob picks Sharon up at a bar, and they have sex. The morning after, Sharon rips up Rob's work visa to write down her number, he calls her out for stealing the tiny products from his hotel bathroom, and she tells him to open up a window because the room stinks. It's love! ""I want you to know that I'm gonna look back on my time with you and remember you as an extraordinarily good-smelling woman with a magical ass,"" Rob tells her. ""And you're smart, so you could even get away with being less attractive and you'd still be fairly attractive."" Good thing he's smitten with her, because it's not long after Rob returns to the States that Sharon finds out she's pregnant, a revelation that leads to this gem of a line: ""I want to build a time machine out of your carcass and make it unhappen."" Season 1: Episode 4 Catastrophe deals with serious parts of being an adult--addiction, aging parents, and, in this episode, pregnancy complications. After finding out about their high risk for having a child with Down syndrome, Rob and Sharon navigate what that would mean for them. ""Sorry I sent you out of the room,"" Sharon says of the amnio. ""I would've let you stay if you weren't audibly crying--you know, if there hadn't been a noise complaint."" Season 1: Episode 5 Thanks to Rob's mother Mia's expert emotional sabotage, Sharon finds out about Betsy, Rob's ex who miscarried. Naturally, she becomes obsessed, looking Betsy up on Facebook and twisting her hair around to create faux-bangs to see what she'd look like with Betsy's 'do. (We've all been there, Sharon.) Meanwhile, Rob gets a new job with the mega-evil Braebrand pharmaceutical company. Oh, and Breabrand is trying to do some, er, PR cleanup after their last drug killed off a bunch of older dudes. ""Well, that's... wow,"" Rob says. ""I mean, I guess if you're gonna be allegedly responsible for some people not being alive anymore, then old men are the best ones."" Season 1: Episode 6 Rob and Sharon's bachelor(ette) parties go totally off the rails. The men head to a strip club, where Fergal is too depressed to wear anything but a bathrobe and Chris runs into an old flame. At Sharon's party, we meet Kate, who is the ACTUAL WORST. Naturally, Kate takes E, bashes her head open, and then runs off with a man who owns a houseboat. Rob and Sharon's wedding is a disaster, too--albeit an awkward, totally sweet one--until their wedding night, which starts with a fight and ends with Sharon's water breaking. Season 2: Episode 1 In a moment that feels like deja vu from Season 1, this episode starts with Rob and a pregnant Sharon in bed. Per usual, they have a big fight (""If you come anywhere near me, I'm gonna scream,"" Rob grumbles.), which leads to sex. And then, surprise! Their toddler, Frankie, and dog burst into the room mid-coitus. Turns out we've jumped forward in time. Baby Number One arrived long ago and Baby Two (with the nearly unpronounceable name Muireann) is on the way. Nearly three years after meeting, Rob and Sharon still fight and freak out, but they're working as a team to make this thing work--particularly when their family and friends show up for a party to celebrate Muireann's birth. Season 2: Episode 2 Sharon deals with Paloma Faith-loving ""mombies"" as she struggles with feeling stuck in motherhood. ""All we do is get me pregnant,"" she laments. ""What are we, farmers?"" Meanwhile, Rob is dealing with a load of sexual frustration--just as Olivia (Emmanuelle Bouaziz), a new French co-worker, enters the scene. She looks like bad news. And, oh boy, is she ever. Season 2: Episode 3 The supporting cast shines in this episode. Chris, now separated from Fran, decides to start having sex with trans women. Keep an eye out for a cameo from Sharon's ob-gyn from Season 1 at the gay club. The language he uses to discuss it isn't totally savory, but, as far as exploring sexual attraction goes, you do you, Chris! After one too many ""sexual rain checks,"" Rob and Sharon take a weekend trip to Paris--and realize they've left the breast pump at home. Season 2: Episode 4 As funny as it is, maybe it's not a great sign that Sharon keeps asking Rob about cheating. Things get dark at their anniversary dinner and we learn the truth about the trauma of Frankie's premature birth. Season 2: Episode 5 Oh, do things take a turn. Rob thinks he's hashed things out with Olivia but he, really, really hasn't. Sharon finds out about the money Rob lent her brother behind her back and realizes she's not ready to go back to work. Season 2: Episode 6 Aaaaand just when you thought things couldn't get worse, everything implodes in a big way. We find out Sharon kicked Rob out after finding out about Olivia's sexual harassment claims. He's staying at Dave's horrifying, krokodil-coated home. When he Googles ""Is alcoholism a myth?"" you know it's not going to end well. Kate shows up for another disastrous night with Sharon--one with serious consequences. Rob and Sharon reconcile, but a lot of ugliness has been pulled out of the box, maybe more than they can shove back in. Why You Should Binge: The show is funny--very, very funny, like, laugh-out-loud-every-episode funny. A lot of it's brilliance comes in the incredibly timed punch lines (always when you least expect it) and, of course, in Sharon and Rob's delight in each other's bad behavior and dirty jokes. If you watch this with a longtime romantic partner, you'll probably find yourself glancing over at them because you've had a moment just like Sharon and Rob--and then you'll be horrified because, oh my god, you've had a moment just like Sharon and Rob. Best Scene--""Gollum"": Just. This. The Takeaway: To quote Sharon, ""It's like if a normal courtship is a dance, then ours is like a heart attack or a seizure or something.""

Case in point: the Armadillo Vault, a self-supporting pavilion comprising 399 limestone slabs and spanning 52 feet, curving and bending around the columns of a 13th-century Venice building at this year's Architecture Biennale. No glue, no mortar, no hidden substructure to ensure the 24-ton edifice doesn't collapse--just really smart architecture. At the heart of what architects and the engineers who work with them do is the opposition between compression (pushing together) and tension (pulling apart). The Eiffel Tower, the stone-clad cathedrals of Europe, every bridge ever--they all rely on balancing these two forces. The Armadillo Vault goes a different direction. Because its limestone blocks form a series of conjoined arches--a classic form that turns compression into strength--it stands with only a minimalist system of tension ties that helps balance the structure at the ground level. That's not to say it doesn't need a little help. ""There's no way to imagine this kind of shape without computation,"" says Philippe Block, director of the research group at ETH Zurich that developed the Armadillo Vault. A few years ago, the Block Research Group created a software package called RhinoVAULT, designed to let architects manipulate tension and compression forces within a 3D model. That's what let them design the Armadillo; because it's inside a world heritage site, the Corderie dell'Arsenale, the team had to redistribute the forces on the floor to have as minimal a footprint as possible. The undulating shape of the final design is what the software came up with, and it's both functional and aesthetic. To build the pavilion, masons followed the RhinoVAULT results to assign the blocks, from a West Texas quarry, numbers and specific locations. Then they built a wooden form inside the pavilion and laid the stones in place atop it--two-inch thick pieces at the top, and five-inch thick pieces near the bottom. Remove the scaffolding and the stones support themselves. ""You can almost not put a razor blade between the stones,"" Block says. And the thing is pretty tough. Block says a football team could dance on top of it--""an American football team,"" he clarifies. Walking inside, visitors can look up and see the forces acting on the blocks etched into the ceiling, a visual representation of the physics that the Armadillo Vault relies on and proof that the flowing, sinuous forms of buildings from architects like Zaha Hadid and Frank Gehry don't need complex steel substructures. Block says design tools like RhinoVAULT could let them build the same elaborate structures with far less material. ""It's a more honest representation of a geometry,"" Block says. ""I think it's also going back to showing what materials can do--even humble materials."" The fact that those materials can also be beautiful is just a bonus. Go Back to Top.

Now, 32 years later, Paul Feig's re-imagined, female-led remake is ramping up its promotional campaign ahead of its July 15 release. Instead of a new trailer, though, Sony rolled out five new featurettes, one on each of the Ghostbusters--Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones)--and the Ecto-1 (played by a classic Cadillac hearse). It's not a ton of new footage, but the featurettes do reveal that the women know their Patrick Swayze film references (including Road House), that Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance) plays Erin's boss at Columbia University, and that Patty isn't just an MTA worker--she's a big-time New York history buff.

But is that a bad thing? Probably not. In his latest ""Everything is a Remix"" video, filmmaker Kirby Ferguson notes that the movie intentionally borrowed from lots of other stories, ""because we love the familiar."" But he also notes that while most films are retellings of previous tales, the ones that truly hit a nerve--like, for example, the original Star Wars--are the ones that combine familiar elements with novel ones. If The Force Awakens comes up short, Ferguson adds, it's because it used too much from the first trilogy (he finds 14 points of overlap). ""The Force Awakens clearly is a remix, but so is everything else,"" he says in the video. ""For as long as humans have been creating, we have been copying, transforming, and combining. The issue isn't the remixing in the film, it's that it's heavy on copying and lighter on transforming and combining."" Watch the video above to dig deep into Ferguson's analysis of the film.

Well, lucky for you, the literary matriarchy is on its way out--all-male book clubs are here to prove you don't need a woman card to check out a library book. According to The New York Times, that includes the Man Book Club, whose founder (after serving bull balls at a meeting discussing Thomas Savage), insisted, ""We do not read so-called chick lit. The main character cannot be a woman."" We're relieved there's finally a safe space for men to discuss books by and about men--a space beyond the pages of literary magazines, lists of award-winners, and every college syllabus of the Western canon. So, now that we've found a place to give the oft-overlooked Hemingway and Franzen their due, only one question remains: What should these book clubs be named? Luckily, Twitter came to the rescue.

Now, almost a decade later, Damon is back in action (and character), and as the first full trailer for this summer's Jason Bourne proves, he's out for justice, and looking for... ...enh, who am I kidding? I can't even fake my way through a straight-laced, straight-faced write-up about this trailer. It's a new Bourne movie! In my house, that very phrase is invoked with Oprah-like, you-get-a-new-car glee: ""Newwwww Boooooouuuurrrnnne Movie!!!"" (I live in an annoying house.) Damon's three Bourne films--including 2002's The Bourne Identity and 2004's The Bourne Supremacy--make up one of the best action franchises of all time, a trio of globe-cavorting, camera-shaking, deeply satisfying conspiracy thrillers in which magazines become weapons, bodies become wrecking balls, and close allies become foes. I've spent the last few years hoping that Damon would return to the character, just so we could see him ingeniously K.O. some glowering-but-well-dressed Euro-goon with a box of crisps while waiting for the Metro. So, let's get to it: Newww Booournee Mooovie!! All we knew about Jason Bourne before today is that it involved cyber-crime and a lot of far-flung locales. But as the first trailer proves, it's also about Bourne--the super-secret government agent with the wonky memory--trying to resolve his past, and helping former co-conspirator Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) when she gets caught up in a hacking conspiracy that one operative notes ""could be worse than Snowden."" Cool, cool--after all, Bourne and Nicky are the classic did-they-or-didn't-they big-screen coupling, and series director Paul Greengrass knows how to deftly expose every layer of a pulpy, powers-that-be scheme. But are there also cool explosions? Yep! European motorcycle chases at night? Of course! Lots of government operatives running around a control room, trying to figure out how Bourne's escaped them yet again?! You bet, and this time, their team includes Tommy Lee Jones and recent Oscar winner Alicia Vikander. Will they be able to contain Jason Bourne and his screeching, awwwww-yeah-inducing Moby theme song? We'll find out when Jason Bourne opens July 29.

Turns out, it's actually doing three. In addition to Edge of Nowhere, a combination of ice climbing and Lovecraftian horror, Insomniac announced today that Oculus Studios also will publish The Unspoken, a player-versus-player game of magic spells, and Feral Rites, a third-person action game. Look for them toward the end of 2016. The Unspoken, says Insomniac's Chad Dezem, is about an ""urban magicians' fight club"" staged in secret arenas around Chicago. Players cast spells using the Oculus Touch motion controllers. Dezem describes it as a ""fighting game meets an arena shooter,"" in the sense that you must accurately input your magic spells using hand motions, but also must consider your position in the arenas, finding cover or taking the high ground. Unspoken's gameplay focuses on that one-on-one multiplayer mode--the single-player mode is largely tutorial. The Unspoken.Insomniac Insomniac's Cameron Christian describes Feral Rites, which uses a standard gamepad controller, as combining ""the exploration of Zelda with the savage combat of God of War."" It's a third-person game with a fixed camera system, so it'll look sort of like God of War (except, like so many VR games, all up in your face). Playing as the son of a slain tribal chieftain, you have the ability to transform into a jaguar-beast form. The beast is ""not just a power-up,"" Christian says--switching strategically between beast and human forms can solve problems. Look for side quests, character progression, item collecting--your standard third-person action-adventure, but in VR. With three very different games in development, Insomniac clearly is going all-in with Oculus and the Rift.

In January, the company had announced that it would publish the next game from Ratchet and Clank studio Insomniac, an adventure game called Song of the Deep. Today, it expanded its ambitions, saying that GameTrust would also publish new games from noted studios Ready at Dawn (The Order: 1886), Frozenbyte (Trine), and Tequila Works (Deadlight). ""Unlike a traditional video game publisher, GameTrust is not part of the creative process,"" GameStop said in a statement. ""Instead, it is focusing on discovering creative and fun games from innovative independent developers that can benefit from GameStop's expertise and retail channels to support marketing and connecting their games with a broader global audience."" GameStop will devote exclusive shelf space in its stores to GameTrust games, it said, and noted that it planned to publish games digitally and on physical discs for consoles, PC, and virtual reality platforms alike. The move into publishing is just one of the steps that GameStop has taken in recent years to diversify its business. Its longtime core business, selling new and used games and consoles--which Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter called a ""melting ice cube"" in a note to investors last month--has been on the decline with no end in sight. This has prompted GameStop's entrance into other, complementary, businesses, such as acquiring the nerd-stuff retailer ThinkGeek and the AT&T wireless retail chain Spring Mobile. Go Back to Top.

The textured stucco walls are made from 107,000 square feet of leftover drywall. It looks like somebody decorated a monastery for a glam-rock high school dance. The installation is the work of Alejandro Aravena, this year's winner of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize and director of the 2016 Venice Biennale. It's made of trash from last year's Venice Art Biennale. The point, he says, is that constraints should not prevent architects from inventiveness. ""Value is not based on the quality of material, but on creative and distinctive use instead,"" Aravena said in a statement. This vision of creating in the face of challenges is a common one at this year's Biennale, the theme of which is ""Reporting from the Front."" In an official statement, Aravena explains the thinking behind the theme, which he selected, with a charming anecdote about archaeologist Maria Reiche, who studied the Nazca pre-Incan culture in Peru. It begins: In his trip to South America, Bruce Chatwin encountered an old lady walking in the desert carrying an aluminum ladder on her shoulder. It was... Maria Reiche, studying the Nazca lines. Standing on the ground, the stones did not make any sense; they were just random gravel. But from the height of the ladder those stones became a bird, a jaguar, a tree, or a flower. Maria Reiche did not have the resources to rent a plane to study the lines from above, nor was there the technology to have a drone flying over the desert. But she was creative enough to still find a way to achieve her goal. The modest ladder is the proof that we shouldn't blame the harshness of constraints for our incapacity to do our job...We would like the 15th International Architecture Exhibition to offer a new point of view like the one Maria Reiche has from atop the ladder. Aravena himself has created a practice around designing under constraints. He calls his method ""incremental design,"" and it often means using limited government funding to build deliberately half-finished structures. The approach lets tenants flesh out their respective units as they please, resulting in government-issued housing that's colorful, vibrant, and personal--like a real home. Go Back to Top.

The stark-white plaster casts of  work--on display at the Venice Architectural Biennale as ""The Evidence Room""--does more than just make visitors uncomfortable (though it does that, too). In responding to the Biennale's theme, ""Reporting from the Front,"" the reconstruction both remembers the Holocaust and refuses to let its literal architects escape without blame. The exhibit actually grew out of a court case. In 1996, Holocaust denier David Irving sued writer and historian Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for libel. Lipstadt's 1994 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory featured Irving's revisionist interpretation of the era. In order to fight Irving's lawsuit, Lipstadt had to prove that the Holocaust did, indeed, happen. The court called on Robert Jan van Pelt, architectural historian at the University of Waterloo. His job, on the stand, was to prove the genocidal intent of concentration camps. He had the proof: the architects who built the crematoriums left behind blueprints and letters. Interior perspective of the gas chamber door (foreground) and gas column (background) in The Evidence RoomThe Evidence Room Van Pelt, along with other professors and students from the University of Waterloo, used that evidence to reconstruct full-scale replicas of a gas column, a gas door, and a gas-tight hatch. They're nightmarish to look at--but looking, and acknowledging, is the whole point. It's a perfect example of the unflinching tone Alejandro Aravena, the latest winner of architecture's prestigious Pritzker Prize and the director of this year's Biennale, is urging architects to adopt in facing difficult issues. ""It is a profound experience for all of us,"" said van Pelt in a statement, ""and, in design terms, a radical, unprecedented investigation into the possibility to represent something unrepresentable: the architectural evidence of a factory of death.""

You've probably heard about these rebuilders--vegan bakeries, lust-worthy watches, and so on. But a slew of ideas for new large-scale construction ideas are in the works, some of which are now on display at the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale. ""The Architectural Imagination"" features 12 proposals, by as many architects, for four underutilized areas in Detroit. Among those proposals are models and blueprints for fairly typical industrial regeneration projects, like urban farms and shared public parks; while others, like a Detroit Reassembly Plant that would recycle material from the city's razed buildings, and a new skyscraper built from wood, from locally grown trees, confront the issue of sustainability.     Our favorite display belongs to Los Angeles architect Greg Lynn, who shows off his plans for the future of the Packard Plant with a HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality headset. The 1905 factory closed in 2010 and even then wasn't fully operational. Lynn reimagines Packard as a new-age factory that manufactures robots and autonomous vehicle technology, with an online retail fulfillment center. The HoloLens view shows people and goods moving through the new facility, a useful visual aid for an architecture exhibit. To imagine the future of a building, it helps to see it in use--even if it's just in hologram form. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Architecture detroit gallery Skip Social.

And That's No Good | WIRED"	"Wired"	"I hate to be that guy. The guy who says stuff like this: ""Kids these days. They don't know what they have. With all these new-fangled smartphones, kids don't know how to play."" I'm not completely that guy, but it's obvious that young people today have different experiences than I did. OK, now to the point: With the start of summer, most children are out of school. And what should they do when they aren't studying or going to class? My answer: Be bored. No, wait! Boredom isn't bad. In fact, it can be good. Sitting around with nothing to do is a great way to think about things that might not normally come to mind. It's a time to bounce a ball off the wall or walk around outside looking for ""stuff"" without knowing what you are looking for. Being bored is what motivates you to take something apart just to see what's inside, even if you may not get it back together. And this is where today's kids have it rough. It's harder for them to get bored. In the blink of an eye, they can pull up a YouTube video or fire up a video game. Why be bored when there's stuff to do? Of course, YouTube and games aren't all bad. My daughter is watching the CPG Grey videos and my older son loves the Crash Course History videos. And there are some super awesome games like Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program. Still, none of them top boredom. What can we do about this? You could of course ban technology, but I don't have the heart to do that because I find this new stuff useful and fun. Instead, I encourage my kids to embrace boredom. I tell them not to simply switch something on right away, but to wait a bit and swim in the feeling. Embrace the lack of focus, because this fuzziness is where you find awesome things. And don't simply consume, but create. Make a video. A game. A tutorial on using your favorite technology or demonstrating a successful game strategy. It doesn't matter what you make, only that you make it. The best kind of boredom is the pure ""stare at the wall"" boredom.  However, that might be a little intimidating for some people.  You might need to add a little sugar to your boredom to take away the kick. With that in mind, here are some starter suggestions for a summer of boredom.  Children might not like these, but I think they are awesome. Raspberry Pi / Arduino. Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer you can program to control stuff, and the Arduino is a programmable processor that you can use to build cool stuff. The possibilities are endless, so check out MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi magazine, to find something cool. (You might want to try a starter kit for Raspberry Pi or Arduino.) I could write an entire post introducing you to these platforms, but you won't find it useful unless you're interested in them. Go play first. Just to show you how fun it be, here's a quick video showing how I made some real buttons to control a Python turtle with Raspberry Pi. Cardboard Armor. Although the Raspberry Pi is super awesome, you have to get a Raspberry Pi to start. If you want to do something with stuff you already have, try cardboard armor. Yes, this is exactly what it sounds like: armor made of cardboard. Google for ideas, or check out an instructables site like this. Take something apart. This can be tricky for two reasons. First, you don't want to break something expensive or useful. Second, there are some things you definitely shouldn't tinker with because they're dangerous (I'm looking at you, CRT TVs). However, there's plenty of junk laying around that you can take apart. What about an old land-line telephone? But be careful with that screwdriver--it can really gash your skin (young Rhett mistake). Learn to program. There are plenty of programming languages and resources available online. I can recommend two. Hour of Code is a great place for younger beginners to start. The curriculum uses graphical programming methods and covers a bunch of great stuff. I also like this short visual introduction to Python (trinket.io). It's Python without having to install anything. Of course, the downside to these is your kid will still be staring at a computer screen. Make something. Anything. Create a board game or invent a game that uses a ball. That's not hard and might even be fun. Build a flashlight using batteries, an LED, and a paper towel tube (my daughter loved doing this). Add some duct tape just for fun. Finally, a word of encouragement. Boredom is good for you, but it requires willpower. Next time you have a free moment, don't reach for your electronic device. Just sit there and do nothing. Boredom is the source of superpowers for both heroes and villains (but don't be a villain). Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Arduino Dot Physics learning science Skip Social.

Christie Hemm Klok/WIRED Tesla's Model S just got more affordable. Elon Musk's electric car company announced this morning it will introduce a version of the sedan with a less powerful 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack, at a base price of $66,000. That makes it a bit cheaper than the previous cheapest version of the car, which started at $70,000. The Model S is still very much a luxury car, and that new lower price is still double what Americans pay on average for a new vehicle. But it's striking because it's the first time Tesla has made one of its products cheaper. Since its 2012 introduction, Tesla has steadily improved the sleek seven-seater--and the price has gone up accordingly. It was introduced for under $60,000, but the base price had risen up to $70,000. (The top of the line model, the P90D, with all-wheel drive and a 90-kWh battery pack, starts at $109,500.) The sedan now comes with all-wheel drive (a $5,000 option on the new 60-kWh version), autopilot, and a slew of software improvements that make driving on electricity more practical. Related Video Meet the Model 3, Tesla's Most Important Car The new Model S 60 will offer a range of more than 200 miles (you get close to 300 in the 90D), a 0 to 60 mph time of 5.5 seconds, and standard active safety features. You get the hardware (cameras and radar) necessary for autopilot, but the software that actually lets you take your hands off the wheel will cost you another $2,500. Interestingly, the battery pack in this new car is in reality a more powerful 75-kWh pack, handicapped to perform as if it were a 60-kWh unit. For $9,500, you can unlock the car at any point with an over-the-air software update, and snag a 19 percent range bump. Tesla says the price drop is a response to potential customers ""who would like to buy a Model S, but can more easily afford it only at a lower price point."" It's possible there are other practical benefits to offering this battery; Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Whatever the reasoning, there's symbolism here. For the past decade, Musk has been promising an electric car for the hoi polloi, to do in this century what Ford's Model T did in the last. That car will be the Model 3, the $30,000 car Tesla showed off in March, but won't start building until late 2017, at the earliest. This Model S is no working man's car, but it's a step closer to the masses. Related Video Gear, Science, Transportation Tesla's Summon Feature Is Like Knight Rider.

So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

All you have to do is push that button. But of course you still have to wait for the ride to come; no one has figured out (yet) how to make it materialize out of thin air. Now Uber wants to approximate that feeling by letting you schedule your ride ahead of time. When you need it, goes the idea, your ride just appears. Starting today, business travelers in Seattle will be able to schedule rides 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. It's the first step in what the company says will be a global rollout of the feature. Uber ""Even though we're an on-demand company, we totally get it,"" says Tom Fallows, Uber's director of global experiences. ""Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave."" After tapping on UberX in the Uber app, users will see a new option to schedule a ride to within a 15-minute window. You'll set their pickup date, time, location, and destination, and you'll be able to edit details up to 30 minutes before the pickup time. You can also cancel anytime without a penalty so long as your ride isn't already on the way. Uber says it will send you reminders 24 hours ahead of your ride, and again 30 minutes before. Passengers will also get a notification after the ride is on the way that includes, among other information, whether or not surge pricing is in effect. Since surge pricing is a strictly real-time computation, Fallows says, users see only the base fare when they initially order a scheduled ride. But if you're not willing to pay the surge pricing, you have a five-minute window to cancel without a penalty after the driver is on the way. Wait longer than five minutes and the standard cancellation fee applies. (The amount varies by city: It's $5 in San Francisco and Seattle, for instance, and 5 euros in Paris.) What the Driver Sees Meanwhile, the process on the driver's end remains exactly the same. ""The most efficient way to do this by far is for us to send your ride request to the nearest driver at the right moment,"" Fallows says. ""So from their perspective, it's a normal ride."" Uber does the technical heavy lifting to decide when to send the ride request out, says Fallows, which includes examining such signals as where all Uber drivers on the network are at that moment; where those drivers are headed and likely to be in the next few minutes; and how long it would take those drivers to arrive at your pickup location. Traffic is another factor, Fallows says, as is the likelihood of a driver accepting your request. Scheduled rides go live today in Seattle, with other ""top business travel cities"" following soon, according to Uber. At launch, the feature is available only to users who have a business profile set up on the service, and only on the UberX tier. The announcement comes shortly after Uber's archrival, Lyft, said it was testing a similar feature among its own employees in San Francisco. Lyft said it would like to offer scheduled rides to regular customers but has no definite plan for releasing the feature. Go Back to Top.

But Uber is eager to show it also has a public-minded side. The ride-hailing giant said today that it had reached a new milestone of recruiting more than 50,000 US veterans as drivers through its UberMILITARY initiative. The company also said it's donating up to $1 million to organizations that support veterans and their families. ""Uber uniquely can be this on-demand income generator,"" says Emil Michael, senior vice president of business at Uber. ""You can turn the app on and make money, and turn the app off when you have other things to do."" The company launched its UberMILITARY initiative in September 2014 as a way to reach out to veterans and their families. From 2009 to 2011, Michael served as a special assistant to the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, accompanying him to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and elsewhere. He says a central concern among veterans is re-integrating into their communities after leaving the service, and he saw a need for flexible work options--like driving for Uber--while they're transitioning into more permanent employment. For the near future, Michael says the company has several more priorities, including paying out as much as a half billion dollars to drivers who have worked or still work in the military by 2020; improving access to military bases; and coming up with a special perks program for veterans who drive on Uber. Robert Isaac Jr., a veteran who's been driving for Uber in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past two years, said he's been surprised to find how easy it is to casually talk with passengers about serving in the military--an otherwise difficult topic for him to bring up in other everyday settings. ""Anyone in the military is more than happy to talk about their experiences,"" Isaac said during an interview at Uber's San Francisco headquarters. ""We know a kind of separation is there, and we want to close that. We're just as normal as everyone else--we just did a different kind of job."" Go Back to Top.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email on-demand economy ridesharing Uber Uber After first launching in, of all places, Toronto, the standalone UberEATS app has finally arrived elsewhere in the US. The standalone app has now officially launched in Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco, after it landed in Los Angeles earlier in March. Uber says it will be rolling out UberEATS in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Melbourne, New York, Paris, Seattle and Washington D.C. in the coming weeks. The company made the announcement with a blog post today. The standalone app works just like the Toronto version: You can opt to get regular delivery from a hundred or so restaurants in the area, with the full menu available for you to pick and choose from; UberEATS offers this service from morning until 10 p.m. everyday, and you can see how long it will take for Uber to get the food to your doorstep within the app (15-20 minutes, 20-30 minutes, etc). Or, if you want food delivered to you faster--Uber says as fast as 10 minutes or so--you can choose Instant Delivery, which features three to five daily dishes in every city, all displayed in big, clean photos in the app. Instant Delivery is only offered between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. during weekdays. ""We learned quickly that requesting a ride and ordering a meal are two very different experiences,"" Chetan Narain, product manager of UberEATS, writes in the announcement post. ""They each deserve their own home."" As we explained when the app first launched in Canada, Uber had to make sure a few things were in order, logistically, for UberEATS to work. Drivers can't arrive at a restaurant too early and waste precious time hanging around while the food is still being prepared; they also can't arrive too late, and risk the food being served cold. Uber says its map-routing algorithms help so that drivers get to the restaurant at the right time, hitting the sweet spot. There's also a separate driver base handling UberEATS deliveries, which doesn't overlap with the group of regular Uber drivers picking up people in their cars. (Drivers can choose to switch between modes freely, by logging into and out of the app.) According to Uber, the partnerships with Instant Delivery restaurants require special arrangements, including a scheduled pickup at the restaurant before 11 a.m. hits. Meanwhile, regular UberEATS delivery is done more ad hoc: orders come through the app, and drivers drive to the restaurants to pick up the food, then bring them to the customer. Uber declined to provide details on how it and participating restaurants split the revenue they bring in, but one can imagine how agreeing to be listed on Uber's app wins these restaurants some high-tech local advertising.

Enter LetterOne, an international investment firm established by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, which just made a strategic $200 million investment in Uber, the world's most valuable private startup. The move, announced on Friday, is meant to help Uber wade even further into emerging markets. LetterOne, founded in 2013 and based in Luxembourg, has typically focused on the telecoms and energy sectors--areas that Fridman has historically invested in. But more recently, the company has been seeking to invest in ""late-stage technology growth opportunities globally,"" according to the company's release. Uber fits in well with this vision, and benefits from the deal in other ways. While the ride-hailing giant dominates the market in the US, it has lagged behind other players abroad, coming in second to Didi Kuaidi in China, Ola in India, and Grab in Southeast Asia. And these players, along with Lyft, Uber's biggest ride-hailing rival in the US, have already moved to form a global anti-Uber alliance. This partnership, the company says, will help Uber boost its local knowledge of many emerging markets. ""Our goal is simple: reliable and affordable transportation everywhere, for everyone, at the push of a button,"" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in the announcement. In other words, if Uber truly wants to dominate globally, it must adapt to local climates and their unique quirks--something a local partner can help with tremendously, especially in emerging markets. In India and the Philippines, for example, Uber allows passengers to pay with cash because it works better with the culture. And yes, $200 million may not sound like much for a company reportedly valued at upwards of $60 billion. But in Uber's greater quest for world domination, a strategic partner may have more value than the specific monetary value of the investment itself. Go Back to Top.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email on-demand economy ride-hailing Uber Uber has agreed to settle two class-action lawsuits over its safety-related advertising. The ride-hailing giant has agreed to pay $28.5 million to around 25 million US passengers who rode in Ubers from January 2013 to January 2016, according to a settlement agreement submitted for court approval today. Among the issues was how it advertised its one-dollar ""Safe Rides Fee."" After attorney fees and administrative costs, passengers who qualify for the payout can expect to each receive a grand total of 82 cents or so. At issue is how company described driver background checks (""industry leading"") as well as how it implemented the fee beginning in April 2014. Because other kinds of background checks are actually more rigorous, the suits alleged, the language was misleading--and riders shouldn't have to pay the fee. Uber said the fee was a way to recover some of its costs in running its background checks, as well as provide 24/7 support to its riders in the event of safety issues. In the settlement, however, the company has agreed to avoid using certain language to describe these operations. From now on, the company says, it will call the ""Safe Rides Fee"" a ""Booking Fee"" instead. ""Accidents and incidents do happen,"" Uber wrote in a blog post detailing the settlement. ""That's why it's important to ensure the language we use to describe safety at Uber is clear and precise."" A federal judge will still have to approve the settlement. To be clear, Uber is changing only the language around its fee, not getting rid of it. San Francisco-based Lyft, Uber's closest rival in the US, has had similar issues (it now calls its ""Trust and Safety Fee"" a ""Trust and Service Fee""). But the processes themselves that led to these complaints are still in place. That's because ridesharing, as with anytime you get into a car with a stranger, comes with a certain amount of inherent risk. Uber has faced its share of publicity over drivers with criminal records finding their way onto its platform. In settling the suit, Uber gets at least some litigation off its plate. But its lawyers still have plenty of work to do. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Lawsuits ridesharing Safety Uber Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Lawsuits ridesharing Safety Uber French taxi unions and Uber are clashing again. Taxi drivers in France have once more gone on strike--shutting down roads, demonstrating across Paris, and blocking access to major airports and railway stations, according to French media reports. At least 2,000 drivers took part in the protests, and police have arrested 20 so far. The latest demonstrations coincided with a broader nationwide demonstration against France's government, including a walkout by air traffic controllers that disrupted flights and a protest by teachers during the school day. But according to journalists on the ground, the taxi protests were by far the most volatile: Security forces reportedly fired teargas at crowds to try to maintain order, and television footage in western Paris showed demonstrators burning tires and blocking several lanes of traffic. Taxi unions say Uber and other ride-hailing apps create unfair competition and are not adequately policed. ""Unfortunately, the governments are weak and as unemployment is pressuring them, they give in,"" Karim Asnoun, head of the CGT taxi union, told The Guardian. ""They think they are creating jobs, whereas for every created job there is one that's destroyed."" Uber, meanwhile, reportedly emailed its French users, describing the strike as an attack on the market for ride-hailing apps in France and asked its users to lend their support to help ease regulations in the country. Uber France spokesman Thomas Meister told The Verge that, unlike previous strikes, today's demonstration isn't specifically aimed at Uber but rather targets ""the general organization and structure of the industry."" But as Uber well knows, its strategy to make its way in France--and other parts of the world--hasn't gone over smoothly in the past. If the problem truly is cultural, as it increasingly appears to be, Uber would do well to figure out how to run its business on France's terms--or risk facing a bumpier road than ever when it comes to trying to take over the world.

At least, it does for a portion of its drivers on a new pilot program. Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, explained that the tactic is meant to corroborate whether a low ""star rating"" from a passenger may have stemmed from how fast their Uber driver was going. ""If the rating is low, we ask why,"" Sullivan said. ""We need to check what actually happened. Mostly it's about talking to both sides. But increasingly technology can help get to the truth."" Sullivan says the measure is part of a mix of methods to address road safety. In North Carolina, the company has provided Bop It toys in the backs of drivers' cars to keep drunk passengers entertained, according to the company--though some have pointed out that the strategy of treating passengers like children could come off as insulting. Some drivers in Seattle, meanwhile, are using color-coded lights to help riders find the right car at night. In the future Sullivan says Uber could use gyrometer data to verify whether drivers were constantly messing with their phones and offer them smartphone mounts. There's no doubt that safety is important. But to Uber's critics, all that monitoring might seem to give Uber more control over its drivers than it ought to have, given the company's stance that its drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Some drivers have already alleged that anything below a 4.6 average rating can get them deactivated from the system. Now, it seems, Uber is looking to have even greater oversight. Go Back to Top.

But Yellow Cab Cooperative doesn't call out the ride-hailing giant as the reason for its woes. Instead, the company said that lawsuits filed by passengers had finally forced it to restructure its business. Last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reported, a San Francisco Superior Court jury found that the company was liable for a crash allegedly caused by a Yellow Cab driver. The jury awarded $8 million to the injured passenger. Not that the Ubers of the world are immune from such pressures. In one tragic instance, an Uber driver on New Year's Eve 2013 ran into a family in a San Francisco crosswalk, killing a 6-year-old girl and seriously injuring her mother and brother. In July, Uber reached a settlement with the family, the terms of which were kept confidential.  But ride-hailing services do have an advantage over traditional taxi companies, at least for now, in the form of billions of dollars in funding. Yellow Cab declined to comment on whether competitive pressures from app-based services like Uber were a factor in its filing. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Lyft ride sharing taxis Uber Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Lyft ride sharing taxis Uber Getty Images Uber wants you to believe it's emerged as the global leader in the world of on-demand rides. To be sure, some signs do already point to that: it's raised more than $10 billion in venture funding, and the company's worth a reported $62.5 billion. Still, it would be shortsighted to assume Uber has the edge in every aspect of the fight, especially in one of the biggest battlegrounds for ride-hailing thus far: China. Last December, Uber announced a metric seemingly designed to let everyone know that it was absolutely killing it: it had hit 1 billion rides worldwide since the company launched in 2009. Not to be outdone, today Didi Kuaidi--Uber's biggest rival in China--announced that it booked 1.43 billion rides--in 2015 alone. That figure, first reported by tech news blog Re/code, is certainly enormous. Didi Kuaidi further claims that it completed 200 million rides in December, and added that Uber's billion rides came only after six years of maturation and an aggressive global expansion--while Didi Kuaidi operated only in China in 2015. On the other hand, though, Didi Kuaidi admits it tallied its rides from seven different services it offers, including private cars, taxis, carpooling, buses, and corporate services, among others. So it's not quite fair to compare those reported numbers directly with Uber's tally. But the announcement speaks to the overarching message Didi Kuaidi badly wants to project: that it's far ahead of everyone else in China. Period. According to research from the China Internet Network Information Center, Didi Kuaidi holds 87.2 percent of the private car-hailing market in the world's most populated country. Its user base in the country exceeds 250 million people. And it holds this majority in spite of the fact that five of Uber's top 10 cities by ride volume are in China. Uber, for its part, has long made it clear that it considers the country to be a central piece of its strategy for growing its ride-hailing business globally. Just today The Wall Street Journal reported that the company poured fresh new funds into its China unit that would value it at $7 billion. Didi Kuaidi isn't retreating from its ambitions to capture a meaningful share of the worldwide ride-hailing market, either. Last fall, the company announced a partnership with Lyft that would link the companies' apps and let Didi users traveling to the US to hail rides on Lyft's platform, and vice versa. In December, Didi Kuaidi and Lyft's alliance expanded to include the ride-hailing leaders in India and Southeast Asia, Ola and GrabTaxi. Together, that global coalition will reach nearly 50 percent of the world's population, according to the companies. Joint partner projects are scheduled to start rolling out in the first quarter of 2016. So yes, it's true that Didi Kuaidi's 1.43 billion rides is yet another boastful metric and an incremental development among many others as ride-hailing companies fight to come out on top all over the world. But with the winds of favor constantly shifting for these companies, one thing's for sure: no one player can--or should--take its dominance in the market for granted. Go Back to Top.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email didi kuaidi on-demand economy ride sharing Uber The global anti-Uber alliance is growing. Today US-based Lyft said it was allying itself with Asia-based ride-hailing companies Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi, and Ola. Together, the alliance will reach nearly 50 percent of the world's population, Lyft said. ""We're excited to join with Didi, Grab, and Ola to make global travel simpler for passengers,"" Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer said. ""This isn't solely a partnership of four companies, but also an opportunity to have a greater impact on the future of our cities worldwide."" The massive global coalition has been a long time coming. Back in September, Lyft and Didi Kuaidi, China's biggest homegrown Uber rival, joined to allow Lyft users visiting China to book Didi drivers from the Lyft app, and vice versa. Now, users of any of these apps will be able to order rides where the other ride-hailing partners are based. (Each company will still handle mapping, routing, and payments in the countries in which they operate.) Ola is the leading ride-hail company in India. GrabTaxi, meanwhile, offers services in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand. Each of the companies says it receives more than a million booking requests a day. Together, they make a seemingly formidable force. Each provides the other an apparently easy way to make inroads in new countries where a preferred service already exists, and quickly achieve scale. In doing so, the alliance would also seem to help these startups go up against the global juggernaut that is Uber. The world's largest ride-hailing company operates in 67 countries, and it's still growing at a rapid clip thanks to billions in funding from optimistic investors. Though no financial details have been divulged in the announcement, the companies revealed their plan to leverage the partnership in other ways. Joint partner products--which might include courier services, food delivery, and other logistics services--will start rolling out in the first quarter of 2016, the group said. Go Back to Top.

It cites sources who shared paperwork filed privately in Delaware. If true, the move comes just months after a private funding round that valued the company at more than $50 billion, and it propels the company into the position of the world's most valuable privately held startup. It will bring Uber's total venture funding to $12 billion. In its final funding round, 17 months before going public, Facebook was valued at $50 billion. At the time, that figure was considered eye-popping. Despite the massive valuation, founder and CEO Travis Kalanick has no immediate plans for an initial public offering. Speaking at a tech conference in October, he said Uber was still in its ""junior high"" stage of development. He said talk of going public now is like ""telling us to go to the prom.""

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email Funding IPO Uber A Florida state agency that had earlier ruled that an ex-Uber driver was an employee has reversed its decision after Uber appealed the case. In May, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity found that former Uber driver Darrin McGillis was an employee, not an independent contractor, when he drove for the ride-hailing company for seven months until April 2015. The state agency resolves claims on unemployment benefits, and in siding with McGillis, allowed him to claim them. Independent contractors don't usually get such benefits--in exchange for the flexibility of choosing their own shifts, the independent classification means they don't receive Social Security, Medicare, or workers' compensation, along with unemployment insurance. Uber appealed the May decision; after a telephone hearing in August, the agency published a new 9-page finding in Uber's favor. It's worth noting that this is yet another isolated decision by a single state agency; it only applies to the claimant either way. Florida's ruling in May was the first time a state agency sided with an ex-Uber driver, and others have followed suit in California. Agencies in nine other states, meanwhile, have sided with Uber that drivers were independent contractors, not employees. But none of these individual decisions carry the weight of court precedent. Uber's more important battle is a federal class-action lawsuit currently under way in California, in which thousands of California Uber drivers are seeking recognition as employees of the company. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the labor lawyer who is representing the Uber drivers, has mentioned the state agency decisions in her arguments in court in the past, saying the rulings strengthen her side's stance. But now it seems, there's one less decision she'll be able to cite. Mcgillis (PDF) Mcgillis (Text) Go Back to Top.

At least at the moment. But outside the US, where Uber is most aggressively seeking growth, its overseas rivals are increasingly banding together in a bid to hamper its rapid expansion. On Monday, Reuters reported that Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Kuaidi had invested in Ola, the biggest ride-summoning app in India. The amount was not disclosed, though the Times of India, citing unnamed sources, previously reported that Didi Kuaidi's stake in the company would be around $30 million. Ola confirmed the investment to WIRED but not the amount. Didi Kuaidi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Didi Kuaidi's investment comes right on the heels of the announcement of its partnership with US-based Lyft. Earlier in the month in New York, the two companies revealed they would link their apps. Lyft users traveling in China could hail Didi Kuaidi drivers from their Lyft app, and vice versa. The feature is set to go live by early 2017. But the partnership appears to go beyond apps. Didi Kuaidi also reportedly invested $100 million in Lyft earlier this year. It has also invested in the Singapore-based ride-hailing company GrabTaxi. All of this cooperation among Uber's rivals signals the emergence of consolidation as the key strategy for challenging the global juggernaut that is Uber. As Uber's most formidable competitor in China--the company's most coveted market--Didi Kuaidi is in a prime position to lead this charge, and it's not shying away from the task. Consolidation is also in the interest of Uber rivals' deep-pocketed investors. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, for instance, have a stake in Didi Kuaidi and Lyft, and Japan-based SoftBank has investments in Ola and Didi Kuaidi. Uber has made no secret of wanting to own the Chinese market, recently raising $1.2 billion in fresh funding to pour into its China operations. It has also expressed a special interest in India, now the world's fastest growing major economy. But its rivals are determined to create at least a few bumps along Uber's road to global dominance.

On Wednesday, class-action complaints were filed against on-demand food delivery companies DoorDash and GrubHub in California state court, alleging that the drivers should not be considered independent contractors, as their companies have deemed them, but official employees. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Boston-based labor lawyer, filed the suits against the two companies, seeking class action status. She also brought forward a complaint in arbitration against Caviar, a curated food delivery service owned by Jack Dorsey's company Square. The Caviar complaint is a little different in that Liss-Riordan represents only one San Francisco driver. After filing a class action complaint against Caviar earlier this year, Liss-Riordan explains, the court ruled that the arbitration clause in Caviar's written agreement was enforceable, requiring workers to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, per complaint, rather than lumping the cases together in a class-action suit. ""There's a lot of commonality among these cases,"" Liss-Riordan tells WIRED. ""Companies basically hope to massively save on labor costs by classifying their workers as independent contractors rather than employees."" That brings the tally of companies Liss-Riordan has brought complaints against to 11, which includes on-demand ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, laundry service Washio, home services Homejoy and Handy, grocery delivery service Instacart, and on-demand delivery services Postmates and Shyp, in addition to DoorDash, GrubHub and Caviar. So far, only the case against Uber has been certified as a class action. Of these companies, a couple--Instacart and Shyp--have reclassified part of its workforce in what looks to be a reaction to pressure from these filings. One company, Homejoy, shut down, citing the suits as a ""deciding factor"" in the decision. The class-action suits against on-demand ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are the furthest along in the process. On September 1, a federal judge in San Francisco granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by three Uber drivers against the on-demand ride company. (Uber is appealing that decision.) Lyft, meanwhile, faces a similar suit, with its class certification hearing in December. ""All of these companies seem to be watching what other companies are doing,"" Liss-Riordan says, ""and thinking they can get away with it.""

On September 1, US District Judge Edward Chen decided that Uber drivers in California could join the case seeking mileage and tip reimbursement from the company. The drivers can also collectively challenge the company on the main issue of worker misclassification--whether they should be considered employees of Uber under the law, rather than independent contractors--which could have far-reaching implications for the on-demand economy's basic business model. The lawsuit against Uber is the furthest along of a slew of recent cases against on-demand companies, including Lyft, Caviar, Postmates and Homejoy, among others. These startups employ freelance contractors, or 1099 contract workers, instead of employees, arguing that this can make the work more flexible than a structured, 9-to-5 job. But as of late, critics have been calling for better protection for these workers, who lack benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, and workers' compensation. Others, meanwhile, also point out that companies who employ this business model stand to save on payroll taxes, undercutting other on-demand tech firms who do make an effort to classify their workers as employees. Uber has largely stuck to the same arguments it used in court. It is ""manifestly erroneous"" that the suit has been certified as a class, the company says, because there is no such thing as a typical Uber driver. That lumps the issues of thousands of drivers into a single suit, Uber argues, whereas there are substantial differences in how drivers use its platform. Beyond that, the company insists, converting Uber drivers to employees would cost the drivers the flexibility they love, because it upends Uber's business model. The appeal (see below) is worth perusing in full.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email gig economy Lawsuits on demand Uber Ride-hailing giant Uber has lost another battle in the incendiary debate over whether or not its drivers should be considered employees. Officials at California's Employment Development Department (EDD) recently determined that an ex-Uber driver qualified as an employee of the company, not an independent contractor, and as such was entitled to unemployment benefits. To be sure, it's one decision by one state agency and only applies to one individual. But an administrative law judge backed the decision on appeal, and Uber ultimately decided not to fight further. ""We disagreed with the decision, but since it only affects one person ...we decided to focus on the bigger picture,"" an Uber spokesperson tells WIRED. That bigger picture is a federal lawsuit filed against Uber that was granted class-action status earlier this month seeking to gain Uber drivers recognition as employees of the company, not independent contractors. Not the First Time This latest decision is not the first time a state agency has determined an Uber driver was an employee. In May, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity found that Uber driver Darrin McGillis was an Uber employee and thus eligible for unemployment insurance. In June, the California Labor Commission, which investigates wage claims, decided that ex-Uber driver Barbara Ann Berwick was entitled to unpaid wages and reimbursement for business expenses in the nine weeks she worked as an Uber driver last year. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston lawyer who is representing the Uber drivers in the class-action suit against the company, has cited the California Labor Commission's decision in her arguments in court. She says this and other decisions by state agencies solidify her side's stance. ""This California decision supports our argument that when a fact-finder sits down to look at the facts, and applies California laws, Uber drivers are employees,"" Liss-Riordan says. For its part, Uber says that other states have determined Uber drivers are independent contractors rather than employees of the company, including labor or unemployment boards in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Indiana, Texas, New York, Illinois, and California--where at least one decision, the company says, came from the EDD itself.

Now, in an apparent move to deepen that alliance, Uber has just revealed that it is giving $5.5 million to the university to support a new robotics faculty chair as well as sponsor three graduate fellowships. ""We're pumped to be part of a growing innovation ecosystem in Pittsburgh that includes world leading research institutions and companies, as well as an increasing number of start-ups,"" Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO, said in a blog post announcing the endowment. It's an interesting move from Uber, the undisputed giant of ride-hailing apps, and a company that has gained notoriety for its obsession with growth. Even after five years, the company is still expanding rapidly; in spite of regulatory hurdles, it's still muscling its way into new markets, both in the US and abroad. But another reason for Uber's outpouring of generosity could be its, ahem, unique relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Not too long after the announcement of their partnership, according to several reports, Uber hired away dozen's of CMU's scientists, leaving one of the world's top robotics institutions in a crisis. Some viewed Uber luring these researchers away as a good thing, certifying the academic institution as a place of opportunity. Indeed, Uber has provided desirable jobs to researchers from other, more unconventional sources in the past, including hiring the two hackers who wirelessly hijacked an Internet-connected Jeep. But others may see the move more as a way to make amends with Carnegie Mellon. And certainly, with competitors like Google bearing down on Uber's as-yet-unattained dream ""to make transportation as reliable as running water"" (read: self-driving cars), the ride-hailing giant needs all the allies it can get.

Stringer said in a speech today he had met with David Plouffe, the political strategist who has been leading Uber's campaign against the bill, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has fiercely defended. But the comptroller didn't let Uber completely off the hook, writing that both Uber and the city need to come to the negotiating table.

According to one Uber-funded study released today, they do. Research group Botec Analysis found that summoning an UberX, the company's budget tier, took less than half as long as calling for a taxi in several low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What's more, the trips themselves cost less than half as much. Calling for an UberX was more reliable and wait times were shorter, according to the study. ""The answer was clear-cut, and consistent across neighborhoods and days,"" writes study co-author Mark Kleiman. To gather data, pairs of riders called for a taxi and an Uber along pre-planned routes. The riders recorded the time between picking up the phone or opening an app and getting in a car. They also tracked how much each ride cost, then switched off. After each ride, whoever took a taxi last time took an Uber next time. Kleiman says the riders didn't know Uber had funded the effort but acknowledged that Uber's backing ""makes some skepticism about our results natural and proper."" ""We would be happy to share our data and methods with other research teams for re-analysis and replication,"" he says. More independent study of the issue is a good idea. Kleiman acknowledges that his study didn't address many of the most trenchant questions around transit: the ethnicity of riders; riders with disabilities; or the lack of access for riders who don't have credit cards or smartphones. He says, ""This study ought to be the beginning of the scientific effort rather than the end."" Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. on-demand economy Uber Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Cars are plentiful in UberPOOL and UberX mode, but on de Blasio mode, the map simply says ""No cars available."" Users who click on that message are greeted with another: ""This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio's Uber cap bill passes."" The City Council is expected to vote on the bill, which the de Blasio administration argues would curb traffic congestion in the city, by next week.

Turns out I wasn't the only one. Today, expense software company Certify released its lastest data on how business travelers are spending money. Their report found that for the first time, travelers used Uber more than traditional taxis. Uber accounted for 55 percent of ground transportation receipts submitted by employees versus 43 percent for taxis. (About 1 percent of receipts were for Lyft rides and another 1 percent for other ride-hailing services.) That's a reversal from last quarter, when Uber had 46 percent of the receipts versus 53 percent for taxis. The spike in Uber use is also taking a chunk out of the rental car business, according to the report. In the second quarter of 2014, 55 percent of people rented a car while traveling on business; that figure dropped by 10 percent during the same period this year. The receipts don't lie, Certify says: ""Uber is fast evolving to become the preferred choice of business travelers for ground transportation."" Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Unlike past expansions, this one will skip last-gen consoles and only be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It's called Rise of Iron, and it's a new expansion in the same vein as last year's The Taken King. It'll add a new zone to the game, the frost-covered Plaguelands, as well as a new endgame raid, new story missions, a three-player ""Strike"" mission (they're like dungeons), and a new enemy faction in the form of a mutated version of the game's first enemies, the insectoid scavengers called the Fallen. There will also be the usual growth for any expansion like this: new weapons, new gear, a higher level cap, etc. Rise of Iron will be out September 20 for $29.99, though you'll need to already own The Taken King and the prior two expansions (along with the base game) to play it.

Now, 32 years later, Paul Feig's re-imagined, female-led remake is ramping up its promotional campaign ahead of its July 15 release. Instead of a new trailer, though, Sony rolled out five new featurettes, one on each of the Ghostbusters--Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones)--and the Ecto-1 (played by a classic Cadillac hearse). It's not a ton of new footage, but the featurettes do reveal that the women know their Patrick Swayze film references (including Road House), that Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance) plays Erin's boss at Columbia University, and that Patty isn't just an MTA worker--she's a big-time New York history buff.

Coming on November 151 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, this iteration will substitute the painfully boring protagonist from the first game for newcomer Marcus Holloway, a young black man from Oakland. Accused of a crime he didn't commit, he's come to San Francisco to fight the power and hack his way to justice.

The president announced his long-awaited endorsement of Hillary Clinton in a YouTube video posted to Clinton's channel today. He congratulates Clinton on becoming the Democratic party's presumptive nominee, saying, ""I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office."" Of course, Donald Trump had something to say about this, immediately tweeting: Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama--but nobody else does! -- Donald J.

Already the tweet is the most popular Clinton has ever sent, and that's saying something, given she had some of the most popular political Tweets of 2015. It may sound like a small thing, but make no mistake, this tweet represents what could be a kind of turning point for the Clinton campaign. It not only represents a level of attitude her campaign rarely leveled at Democratic rival Bernie Sanders online. It's also an indication that the campaign may be prepared to be more nimble in responding to what are sure to be Trump's all too frequent twitter attacks. One criticism of Clinton during primary season is that she always appeared a little too rehearsed, a little too cautious, when up against Sanders. In reality, what the social media age now craves is an air of off-the-cuff authenticity. Trump is a master of conveying that quality. Now, we'll see if Clinton can bring this same online agility to the debate stage and beyond this fall. As for Obama, who was, of course, the catalyst to this catfight, he said he's eager to get on the campaign trail with Clinton, and also thanked Bernie Sanders on his hard-fought campaign. Obama noted that embracing Sanders' message ""is going to help us win in November."" That includes not just the substance of that message, it seems, but the style, too. Go Back to Top.

In honor of that moment in history--and before the results of today's six primaries are announced--the Clinton campaign has released a video that celebrates the former Secretary of State's accomplishment, positioning it as the climax of decades of work stretching back to the women's suffrage movement in the 1800s and the women's liberation movement of the 1960s. The video features footage and famous quotes of prominent female leaders, including Gloria Steinem and Rosa Parks, and of course, Clinton herself. These include Clinton's famous declaration at the 1995 UN Conference on Women: ""Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights, once and for all."" The video, which urges supporters to ""keep making history,"" represents a turning point in Clinton's campaign. Now, as she readies herself for battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose support among women in the United States is dismal, Clinton is embracing with both arms not only the historical significance of her pending nomination but the obvious electoral advantages is could give her in November.

Share this story on Facebook Share this story on Twitter Share this story on Pinterest Share this story via Email election 2016 Hillary Clinton Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti told employees Monday that the media giant is dropping the Republican National Committee as an advertiser, now that Donald Trump is the party's presumptive nominee. In an email to the staff, Peretti explained the decision, likening Trump ads to cigarette ads. ""We don't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health,"" Peretti wrote, ""and we won't accept Trump ads for the exact same reason."" Peretti took particular issue with Trump's proposed ban on Muslims, his approach to immigration, his comments about women, and his threats to limit the free press. ""We certainly don't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company,"" the email reads. ""However, in some cases we must make business exceptions."" Buzzfeed's decision to withdraw from the advertising deal illustrates just how thorny Trump's relationship with the media has become. As the candidate consistently bashes the press as ""dishonest"" and ""disgusting,"" those same media outlets are struggling to remain unbiased, while also acknowledging that Trump's campaign--and many of its platforms--are anything but normal. Just as Trump is rewriting the rules around how politicians are supposed to behave, he's also rewriting the rules around how responsible journalists need to cover what is a historically incendiary and polarizing candidacy. Peretti insisted that the advertising decision won't impact Buzzfeed's coverage of Trump, and yet, it's tough not to read this as, well, whatever the opposite of an endorsement is. Buzzfeed is not, however, the first media outlet to take such a public stand. The Huffington Post, which Peretti co-founded with Arianna Huffington, famously published all its early Trump coverage this election cycle under its Entertainment section. By December, it reversed that decision, but now ends its Trump coverage with a note that reads, ""Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."" Trump's campaign has also put new media sources, like Facebook, in a tricky position, as the company tries to balance its responsibility as a news source without appearing to back Trump's policies. Earlier this year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, an immigration activist, appeared to criticize Trump's plan's to build a wall on the Mexican border. Weeks later, when Facebook was accused of suppressing conservative content in its Trending Topics feature, that comment was considered by some to be evidence of Facebook's clear liberal bias. In a typical election year, it's unlikely these public figures--particularly those in the journalism business--would feel so justified in speaking out against one candidate over another. But with Trump's historically low favorability ratings and his widespread rejection within the Republican party, it's clear that this is no typical election year. To pretend that it is risks normalizing Trump's most radical ideas. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

She depicted her Republican opponent as ""temperamentally unfit"" to be President of the United States, and for proof, she pointed to Trump's Twitter feed. ""Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry but America's entire arsenal,"" Clinton said. Clinton lifted lines from Trump's own speeches, interviews, and social media accounts and used them to paint a picture of a candidate who does not have a coherent plan for the country, ""just a series of bizarre rants."" The audience in San Diego laughed as Clinton paraphrased Trump's stance on everything from war to North Korea to climate change. ""He says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or ambassadors, because he has, quote, 'a very good brain,'"" Clinton said. ""He believes climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" #NeverTweet The former Secretary of State also rightly predicted that Trump might have something to say about these barbs. ""We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table: bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets. I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.""

The speech was a sneak peek of what the general election season is bound to look like--and how it will play out online. Taking a cue from her nemesis, Clinton leaned more heavily on personal attacks, rather than policy talk, managing to steal the news cycle from Trump for the day.

It's not designed to help you."" The president sounded at turns exasperated and confounded as he addressed the people of Elkhart, Indiana, a town he last visited during the throes of the recession in 2009, and which he said he chose today ""precisely because this county votes Republican."" ""If the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you who will have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class,"" Obama told the crowd before laying out what he believes the differences between those visions are. For Obama, the speech was a chance to boast about his administration's economic achievements--including the country's consistent job growth and a shrinking deficit--while bashing the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who Obama believes would derail that progress. Without ever mentioning his name, Obama took Trump to task over everything from his tax policies to immigration to trade to his ""provocative"" tweets. ""I'm not here looking for votes,"" Obama said. ""I'm here because I care deeply as a citizen about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over the last seven and a half years."" Populist POTUS Not that Obama shied away from sounding the kind of populist note that has characterized the 2016 campaign season. He called Trump's proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants ""a fantasy"" and rejected the idea that immigrants are responsible for stagnating wages in this country. Instead, he laid the blame on another popular target--corporate elites. ""Those decisions are made in the board rooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker,"" he said. He went on to frame Trump as a candidate who only has the interests of the rich at heart. He attacked Trump's plans to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, and lambasting his proposed tax plan which would provide a major tax cut to the top .1 percent of American earners. ""That will not make your lives better,"" Obama said. ""That will help people like him."" Trade-offs On trade, Obama called the idea that ""other countries are killing us on trade,"" which is a frequent Trump talking point, a myth. He argued, instead, that while trade and technological advancement have hurt certain industries, they've helped others, like agriculture and technology. He also emphasized the importance of trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership in dictating the terms of trade. ""If you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century, and they're trying, then TPP makes sure we set the rules,"" Obama said. On that point, at least, Obama was not just fighting Trump's anti-trade rhetoric. Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have publicly opposed the deal as well. With that exception, the president's talk could have easily been ripped from the stump speeches of either of the Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. On nearly every economic issue--from pay equity to labor standards to investment in infrastructure--Obama painted a doomsday scenario on the right. ""When I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention,"" Obama said. ""If we fall for a bunch of okey doke, just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.""

On Saturday night, Bernie Sanders' supporters reportedly revolted against the Nevada Democratic Party, accusing it of intentionally rigging the convention to favor Hillary Clinton. The fight continued throughout the weekend as aggrieved Sanders supporters deluged Nevada Democratic Chair Roberta Lange with sexist and threatening texts and voicemails. Today, the Vermont senator issued a statement condemning any instances of violence carried out by his supporters. At the same time, he denounced what he called a corrupt system within the Nevada state party. ""Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,"" Sanders said in a statement. But, he added: ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place."" At issue is the fact that though Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign has been actively organizing to win county conventions. By amassing more delegates at these county conventions, the Sanders campaign stood to cut into Clinton's delegate lead at the statewide convention. But the Nevada State Democratic Party denied credentials to 64 of Sanders' delegates, saying that they either weren't registered as Democrats or that their records couldn't be verified. In the end, six of them received credentials, but the vote still tipped in Clinton's favor. The room soon erupted in protests. Meanwhile, the chaotic scene has created waves within Sanders' massive Reddit community as well. Moderators are urging Sanders supporters to avoid the kind of language that could get them in trouble with the media. ""They're  expecting  us to act this way. If we take the bait and react violently and/or with threats of violence, we play right into their hands,"" one moderator wrote. ""Remember, what would Bernie do?"" Setting aside the issue of violence, however, it's a little ironic to see the Sanders campaign accusing the state party of rigging the contest. Sanders has often criticized party leaders for trying to subvert the will of the people. But in this case, it's Clinton who won the Nevada caucus to begin with and Sanders who's using the cryptic system of delegate math to gain the edge.

With these two new designs, Moto parent company Lenovo is jumping hard on the current modular smartphone trend. As he paced the stage at a press event in San Francisco, Lenovo product engineer (yep) Ashton Kutcher unveiled two new phones. He called the new Moto Z ""a redesign of the phone from the ground up,"" comparing it to the groundbreaking Motorola handsets of yesteryear like the StarTac and the Razr. They don't look quite as revolutionary as those market-upending devices. The new Moto Z has mostly high-end specs: a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, and super-fast charging. It has a 13-megapixel camera on the back, and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front. It's super-thin, at only 5.2mm. Remember when the first Droid Razr was so thin? This is the next phone in that line. The Z Force has Motorola's ShatterShield technology, which means you can drop your phone on your marble floor or throw it at your assistant and nothing will break (on the phone anyway). The Z Force represents the combination of all the best Droid ideas--the super-thin body, the unbreakable screen--and the awesome customization of the Moto X. It's the Moto Mods that are the real selling point, though. Just attach an accessory to the 16-pin port on the back of the phone, and the Z becomes something new. Motorola announced a projector called InstaShare, which makes the phone huge but adds a big battery and kickstand while turning your phone into a wall-sized screen. Another, built with JBL, adds a big speaker to the back of the phone. It's important to not that Project Ara, Google's modular smartphone initiative, was originally a Motorola project. (Remember ""MAKEwithMOTO""?) Clearly, the ethos hasn't left Motorola, even though Ara did. However, the Moto Z phones aren't quite modular the way Project Ara is. Ara phones let you swap screens, cameras, and batteries. Motorola's approach is more like the one LG used in its new G5, where extra modules are plugged into an already complete phone to extend its phoneness. Motorola has come up with an easier switching mechanism, and Moto Mods is a way better name for the modules than LG's ""Friends."" It's smart: many people will never use the mods at all, and can just use the Moto Z like the super-thin phone that it is. Or, they can wonder what those pins are good for besides feeling good under your fingers, and turn their phone into something cool and new. The Moto Z is coming out this summer for Verizon customers, and for other carriers and countries later this year. Motorola's working with developers to build mods for the device, and are imagining everything from a huge battery to a laptop dock to a virtual keyboard. The pitch is the same as for every modular phone: everyone needs something unique, and you should be able to have the phone you want. Still pretty hard to argue with that. Go Back to Top.

At this point, it's a good idea to enable two-factor authentication on Twitter, and if you're using the same password somewhere else, change it just to be safe. There's some confusion about how the data leaked, and the extent to which it's a concern. Twitter says that it was not directly compromised. LeakedSource, a site that aggregates hacked data sets, says it received a collection of more than 32 million records that include some combination of an email address, a Twitter username, and a password. It suggests that a single piece of unknown malware could be to blame for the breach, but Jake Williams, founder of the cybersecurity consultancy Rendition InfoSec, considers that unlikely. ""I don't think that really makes sense,"" he says. He is skeptical of the malware theory because many of the compromised passwords that appear in plaintext have blank password fields. ""If there was malware on your machine,"" he says, ""I would expect it to log your password whether or not you chose to save it. The only time the hypothetical malware would be stuck with a blank password would be when the password was not saved and the user never logs in by typing their password while the malware is active."" My guess is that this is probably the result of users who share passwords among sites with less secure password storage practices. Jack Williams of Rendition InfoSec He suspects bad password hygiene. ""My guess is that this is probably the result of users who share passwords among sites with less secure password storage practices,"" says Williams. The timing supports that idea. The other Twitter data set, comprising 71 million accounts, has been offered up on the black market by Peace, the same hacker who has claimed responsibility for the recent hacks of MySpace and LinkedIn. Those leaks were an order of magnitude larger than this reported Twitter incident. Over 360 million MySpace accounts were compromised, along with 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords. In other words, if just 20 percent of those MySpace users recycled their email and password for their Twitter account, that gets you to 70 million ""hacked"" accounts with no effort on the part of the hackers other than a little cross-referencing. Security researcher Troy Hunt, meanwhile, suspects that much of the data base may be outdated or otherwise useless. ""It looks almost certain that this isn't a breach of Twitter itself, rather an aggregation of data from unknown sources,"" says Hunt. ""It's highly unlikely there are 32 million credentials in there that are usable against Twitter accounts."" Protect Yourself Ultimately, this looks like a ""better safe than sorry"" scenario. It's a good prompt, though, to enable two-factor authentication on Twitter if you haven't already. That's going to give you an extra layer of protection if someone swipes your credentials. It's also easy! Go to Twitter on your desktop, click on Profile and Settings in the upper right-hand corner (it's hiding under your avatar). From there, go to Mobile, enter your phone number, and type in the confirmation code that Twitter texts you. Then, under Privacy and Security, check the box that says Verify login requests. You'll be sent one more confirmation code to make extra-sure it's you, and that's it! From now on, attempts to sign in from new devices will require a special code sent to your phone only. While you're at it, if you're someone who uses the same password everywhere, it's time to start mixing it up. Start fresh! Get a password manager, even. It's a temporary headache that could save you a lot of trouble down the road. You can find tips from several password experts here, the most important of which are to prioritize length over complexity (16 characters minimum, please), and never to use the same password across multiple accounts. That may be, after all, what has gotten so many Twitter users in trouble in the first place. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Passwords peace twitter twitter hack Skip Social.

On an almost daily basis, new collections of data from hundreds of millions of stolen accounts have appeared on the dark web, ripped from major web firms and sold for as little as a few hundred dollars each worth of bitcoins. And behind each of those clearance sales has been one pseudonym: ""Peace_of_mind."" ""Peace_of_mind,"" or ""Peace,"" sells data on the dark web black market TheRealDeal. His or her ""store"" page has a 100-percent satisfaction rating and feedback like ""A+++,"" and ""follows up with your questions and delivers promptly."" And Peace's growing selection of merchandise includes 167 million user accounts from LinkedIn, 360 million from MySpace, 68 million from Tumblr, 100 million from the Russian social media site VK.com, and most recently another 71 million from Twitter, adding up to more than 800 million accounts and growing. Just how Peace obtained that data is far from clear. Much of it is from older breaches, dating back to as early as 2012. But the consequences have already been serious--likely due in part to victims reusing passwords between sites--and include hackers compromising the Twitter accounts of Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter founder Ev Williams, a multitude of celebrities including Drake and Katie Perry and likely many more less-visible attacks. In fact, these breaches are so large it's hard to imagine anyone with a digital life who is not in some way affected. Earlier this week, WIRED approached Peace through the RealDeal market messaging system and interviewed him or her via encrypted, anonymous IM. Almost none of Peace's claims could be confirmed. Take them only as the unverified statements of a mysterious, pseudonymous, brazenly criminal hacker. Here, with some editing for clarity, is how our conversation went, which took place on Monday, June 6. [Editors' note: After some initial back-and-forth to verify Peace is the same person WIRED contacted on the RealDeal black market...] WIRED: My first question, how have you got your hands on all these collections of breached user credentials? Peace: Well, all these have been hacked through [a] 'team,' if you want to call it that, of Russians. Some have been my work, others by another person. Are you Russian, yourself? Yes. Can you tell me where you're based? At this point due to multiple investigations I would not want to say. Is there a name for your ""team""? At this time I can not give out details like that, sorry. It seems like much of the data you're selling is old (though still clearly useful for hackers.) The Linkedin data is from 2012, for instance, and the MySpace data also seems to be from 2013. How did it happen that you came to possess this old data and are only selling it now? It's fun f**king around with these people---MySpace, Tumblr, LinkedIn---as they threaten to investigate and cooperate with law enforcement. Peace Well, these breaches were shared between the team and used for our own purposes. During this time, some of the members started selling to other people. The people who we sold to [were] selective, not random or in public forums and such, but people who would use [the data] for there own purposes and not resell or trade. Although [after] long enough, certain individuals obtained the data and started to sell [it] in bulk ($100/100k accounts, etc.) in the public. After noticing this, I decided for myself to start making a little extra cash to start selling publicly, as well. So you're doing this separately from the rest of your crew? Are they OK with you selling this data on your own? Well this crew is no longer together. The leader ""retired"" if you want to call it that, a long time ago, however a certain some one (Tessa) started selling without permission. Most of the members went on to do other things and a lot aren't in contact, so there wasn't any ""consequence"" for his actions. For me personally given the fact that it was long ago I thought I'd join in and start selling, too. [Editors' note: Someone using the handle ""Tessa"" has in fact provided 32 million Twitter users' data to the breach tracking website LeakedSource.com.] Why didn't the crew want to sell the whole collection earlier? It is not of value if data is made public. We had our own use for it and other buyers did as well. In addition buyers expect this type of data to remain private for as long as possible. There are many [databases] not made public for that reason and [in] use for many years to come. What was your ""own use"" for it? How were you able to make more by selling the data privately? Well, [the] main use is for spamming. There is a lot of money to be made there, as [well as] in selling to private buyers looking for specific targets. As well, password reuse--as seen in recent headlines of account takeovers of high profile people. Many simply don't care to use different passwords which allows you to compile lists of Netflix, Paypal, Amazon, etc. to sell in bulk. (50K/100K/etc) How much would you say the crew made selling parts of the LinkedIn database privately, for instance, before you started selling the whole collection? I don't think that would be in my best interest to disclose that information. However I can say for me personally, selling publicly, [I've made] $15K for LinkedIn. How much for the MySpace and Tumblr data? For both, almost $20K. Like, $10,000 each? More for Myspace. For Tumblr a couple Gs in total...but mostly myspace due to the fact that Tumblr had salt for the hashes. The Myspace data was also hashed, wasn't it? But not salted? Yes, it was hashed, however no salt. [Editors' note: For more information on hashing and salting, read this explainer.] How much for the Fling data? That was about $1,200 or something like that, can't remember exact amount. Do you have more collections that you haven't put up for sale yet? Yes, about another 1B users or so, again in the same timeframe: 2012-2013. From which services? Social media and email services, mainly. More on the Recent Breaches Hack Brief: Your Old Myspace Account Just Came Back to Haunt You Time to Lock Up Your Twitter Account With Two-Factor Hacker Lexicon: What Is Password Hashing? Security News This Week: A Deluge of Mega-Breaches Dumps on the Dark Web Which sites, I mean? Can you be specific? Well, I can't say for now. I don't want those companies getting a head start sending out password resets. When do you plan to start selling the rest? Sometime this week for my next [one.] I will probably do one every week. [Editors' note: Peace put up the Twitter data for sale on Thursday morning, three days after this conversation.] How many sites/services are there in total? Hmm...about seven which are over the 100M user count. If I include smaller ones--20M, 60M, etc.-- another five. How were you or your crew able to compromise all these sites? Well, that's up to the companies and law enforcement to find out. I hope this doesn't sound rude, but why did you agree to talk to me? No, well, it's fun fucking around with these people--MySpace, Tumblr, LinkedIn--as they threaten to investigate and cooperate with law enforcement. I'd rather give them a bone to chew on, so to speak, make them feel like they can catch me or others. And you're sure you can evade law enforcement? Haha, yes, where I am at. It seems like a lot of risk for the $25K or so you say you've made so far. Well, that is publicly. And in less than a month. It is no risk for me, as they can't do anything. Like I said, quick easy cash in about a month. [I] should have enough to go buy a nice car. Are you confident you won't be caught because you're in Russia? Don't the Russian police occasionally extradite hackers? A billion-plus passwords might be enough to get some attention. Well, it is a little more complicated than that, but I have plans in case something happens. Where does your name ""peace_of_mind"" come from? Well, it was just supposed to be ""peace,"" however [that] was taken on [the Real Deal dark web] market. [It] just came to mind, really, nothing special. Why ""peace,"" then? [No answer] Can you prove that you really have a billion more passwords from 12 sites ready to sell? Readers will be skeptical. Tell them to check their inbox for a password reset in the next week or so. [Editor's note: WIRED requested evidence of that still-to-come breached data. Peace initially offered to send some sort of sample of the data and we agreed to check back in the next day or two. But after two days Peace still hadn't provided anything.] Go Back to Top.

You can now add to that list Microsoft, which is turning its augmented reality (AKA ""mixed"" reality) technology, HoloLens, into a broader platform that incorporates VR as well. When Microsoft first unveiled HoloLens, it also kicked off Windows Holographic, the platform that lets Windows 10 developers build apps and experiences for the device. Today's announcement sets a Windows Holographic standard that third-party manufacturers can use to build their own devices -- including VR headsets -- essentially making them HoloLens-compatible. SEE ALSO: HoloLens IRL: What it's like in Microsoft's version of augmented reality That compatibility is key to the collaborative experiences that Microsoft is envisioning with HoloLens. After making the announcement at the Computex trade show in Taipei, Microsoft released a futuristic video, complete with advanced Minority Report-like gestures, that shows several colleagues using HoloLens and other gear to collaborate on planning a retail space. Notably, one of the parties uses a VR headset to join the discussion remotely. Live onstage at Computex, Microsoft's Windows head Terry Myerson and HoloLens architect Alex Kipman teased something a little closer to home: a planned integration with the HTC Vive. The Vive is particularly good for connecting with Windows Holographic since it's equipped with a camera and room sensors, which help power mixed-reality experiences. Since high-end VR headsets like the Vive and Oculus Rift are PC-based, they're relatively easy to integrate into Windows Holographic, and Microsoft says it's partnering with PC makers and others to bring more dedicated VR gear and computers to market that are WH-ready. But the strong potential on the PC side is counterbalanced by Windows' utter non-presence in mobile. That means, however promising Microsoft's platform play may be, it's not going to have anywhere near the impact of Google Daydream or Samsung's Gear VR. A ""hologram"" as seen via the HoloLens. Image: Lance Ulanoff/Mashable But that's not really the intent. While VR devices are included in Microsoft's offering, the goal is to chart a path for making standalone VR and AR experiences become collaborative. It's great to be able to move virtual objects around a room, but it's 10x better if your remote colleague can grab the nearest headset and see exactly what you're seeing. SEE ALSO: The phones of 2017 will be all about VR Will it pay off? Microsoft does hold sway with manufacturers, and no one, not even Google with Daydream or other players in AR, is really offering anything like the augmented-reality experiences of HoloLens. Facebook has shown a similar vision of shared VR experiences (complete with selfie sticks), but it remains mostly a vision. Now Microsoft has shown its vision for how we'll work in these new realities -- virtual, augmented and mixed -- but it's also taken an important step in providing the tools to create it. The question now is: Will enough people want to go there? Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

They made a movie?"" That seems to be the knee-jerk response from movie viewers who haven't heard of Popstar: Never stop never stopping, but fans familiar with The Lonely Island's body of work know their abilities extend well beyond gift-wrapped genitalia. In Popstar, the immensely talented trio of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone team up for a musical mockumentary stuffed to the gills with absurd humor and crazy cameos, and the result is raucously entertaining. The hilarity is as relentless as the title suggests, but you kind of wish it would never stop. SEE ALSO: Andy Samberg and Adam Levine perform 'Popstar' single on 'The Voice' Popstar, directed by Taccone and Schaffer, is the story of Conner4Real (Samberg), the world's biggest musical star who has ascended to solo icon status after a break from his three-piece ensemble outfit Style Boyz (sound like anyone you know?). Former Style Boy Owen (Taccone) then joins Conner on tour, while their third friend Lawrence (Schaffer) becomes a woodworking recluse.  Like any boy-band documentary worth its salt, Popstar introduces us to Conner at a turning point in his career -- at the top of his game, lauded by fellow artists and anticipating a sold-out tour and platinum album release. Samberg manages to make Conner appear -- well, for real. He's ludicrous, but not so much so that he can't be redeemed. He's naive, but able to grow, and arrogant, but remorseful and eventually more mature. As Conner's career nosedives, his anger and pain feel real -- a step above comedies with a similar sensibility but mercifully shy of a real-life doc. Conner having one of the film's less-traumatic fan encounters (you'll know the alternative when you see it). Image: universal The film's trailer boasted dozens of cameos from every corner of Conner's life, and all together that crowdedness challenges the cast of comedians to make their few seconds or minutes on screen count. Maya Rudolph manages that with a little choice pronunciation in her scene as corporate sponsor Deborah, as does Seal when he does Conner a favor. In a film where Pink rides a unicorn and Justin Timberlake cuts carrots, the most riotous guest scenes belong to the coterie of Will Arnett, Chelsea Peretti, Eric Andre and Mike Birbiglia, whose running media commentary inflates and punctuates the film at perfect intervals.  The songs are intensely, unabashedly Lonely Island in style, with the best beat blown up right out the gate by ""Humble."" ""Finest Girl"" may have shocked casual SNL viewers, but it fits right into the Popstar world along with ""Equal Rights,"" a gay-panic rap masquerading as social good. The production handles the heightened drama of documentaries and fiction with expert care. There are moments that emulate the high stakes of Empire, contextualized with the knowledge that maybe the music industry isn't life-or-death.  Schaffer, Taccone and Samberg on the set of Conner's mansion in 'Popstar.' Image: universal A thin and obligatory reading would yield that the Style Boyz are The Lonely Island and Conner stands in as an exaggerated depiction of Samberg's television and film career, but the film is clearly a love story and a love letter. It's about three friends who work best when they're together, made by those friends who have been collaborating and supporting each other for almost 20 years. Popstar is in every way a group effort, with songs and script penned by its three creators. The most evocative scenes are of the trio making music in a farmhouse or home video footage from the Style Boyz' past, because we know it to be true. In those scenes, it becomes a Lonely Island documentary, which would have been decidedly less compelling since they're exemplary friends and colleagues. In the end, you become invested in Conner's success, because he and The Lonely Island come from those home videos of kids making each other laugh. His success is their success, and the success of dorky kids around the world who want to work forever with their dorky friends. With Popstar, The Lonely Island proves that they're only just getting started. And we hope they never stop. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

But while DJI's Phantom 4 is both super smart and easy to control, it's nowhere near as easy to carry around as the Dobby selfie drone. Created by Chinese drone maker ZeroTech, the Dobby is a super small and compact drone that's barely larger than the palm of your hand and weighs just under half a pound. SEE ALSO: Xiaomi takes on DJI with its ultra-cheap Mi Drone The most notable thing about the drone is its foldable propeller blades. All four of them tuck into pill-shaped body for easy storage. Image: gizchina The drone is controlled with a smartphone app and it can take off in various ways. According to a company promotional video, the Dobby can take off from your hand when you use a voice command and when you pat it. Yes, pat the drone. Furthermore, you can control the drone using hand gestures. The Dobby is suitable for both indoor and outdoor flight; there are blade bumpers that can be attached for safety. And like the Hover Camera, the Dobby can hover in place and record video in up to full HD 1080p resolution from its 13-megapixel camera. It can also take 4K-resolution still photos with burst mode. Photos and videos can then be shared to social networks via the smartphone app.  It's got object and face-tracking capabilities so it can automatically follow you around while recording video. It's also got object and face-tracking capabilities so it can automatically follow you around while recording video. Another fun feature: It can carry small objects. Our guess is the payload needs to be lighter than the drone itself. Parrot's toy-like Airborne Cargo drone can also carry small objects like little toy figurines. Battery life is reportedly only about nine minutes. That said, the Hover Camera only flies for eight minutes on a battery. Additional batteries will be a must.  The Dobby selfie drone sounds like a cool toy and could be a serious challenger to the Hover Drone. You can pick one up from Alibaba's Taobao for RMB 1,899 (about $290).

Samsung announced on Tuesday it will be launching a 512GB solid-state drive measuring 0.78 x 0.63 x 0.06 inches (20 x 16 x 1.5 millimeters). That's about the size of your average postage stamp, and one-fifth of the size of a normal SSD. SEE ALSO: Intel launches first-ever 10-core desktop processor It's called the PM971-NVMe, which isn't the most memorable name, although remember this is a computer component -- not really meant for the general public. Instead, Samsung is setting its sights on ultra-thin notebook and tablet manufacturers. The PM971 doesn't connect to a computer through a conventional (SATA) connection, instead it can be installed directly on the motherboard which drastically increases its speeds. According to the Samsung, this little drive can download a 5GB HD movie in about 6 seconds with reading and writing speeds of about 1.5GBps and 900MBps respectively. And it weighs about 0.04 of an ounce (1 gram). The PM971 doesn't fit into any normal motherboard slots, it is connected directly onto the board. Image: samsung Samsung will be putting out 512GB, 256GB and 128GB options Samsung's new SSD allows manufacturers to offer slimmer and faster laptops and tablets, and the tiny size of the PM971 could allow for huge amounts of storage on future products without sacrificing volume. For now, Samsung is currently mass producing 512GB, 256GB and 128GB options, although it didn't release price information. Previously, Samsung paved the way for smaller and faster computer storage with the XP941, which is over five times larger than the PM971 at 3.15 x 0.87 inches (80 x 22mm) and connects through PCIe slots, which had previously been relegated to things like video, audio and Internet cards. While these PCIe SSDs are faster than SATA SSDs, they still aren't as fast as the new motherboard-connected SSDs. A diagram showing the size difference between a standard SSD, an XP941 PCIe SSD and the new PM971 SSD.

Sure, he's thrilled to hear the latest work by an artist he admires, but with his laptop and a library of other music, this kid has a plan. With its growing popularity on network serials and reality TV, Bollywood -- India's Hindi-language film industry and the songs from its musicals -- is hot on the lips of entertainment aficionados around the world. With dazzling colors and dizzying choreography, Bollywood dance has gained enormous popularity in the United States. For first-generation Indian Americans, dance and music are anchors to their parents' culture, even if it is rooted thousands of miles from home. American college teams perform and compete using different types of Indian dance, and as these styles began to evolve and mix, so too did another artistic fusion: music.  From Bollywood and bhangra to pop and hip-hop, young DJs around the country are combining the sounds of the East and West in online mashups and mixtapes. SEE ALSO: Spotify Party wants to be the DJ for all your get-togethers For the South Asian American diaspora, music presents a unique way of marrying multiple cultures. Music and dance are inextricably linked in India: Classical dance styles are set to Hindustani and Carnatic music, with dancers required to understand different keys and tempos as part of their dance education. It makes sense, then, that the burgeoning fusion dance scene would have a musical counterpart. Bhangra, bhangra, bhangra Before the world caught Bollywood fever, it was folk music and dance from the North Indian state of Punjab that got attention in the West. Bhangra teams and competitions took hold at American colleges and the genre's infectious drum beats and melodies permeated pop culture. ""I always had a very strong cultural tie to Sikh Punjabi culture,"" says Iqwak Bhurji, 28, who DJs under the moniker Klasikhz. ""When I came out here to the States, one of the most important elements for me was the concept of the arts. It was literally the most pure form that allows people of different worlds to just kind of communicate. That's a very cliched statement, but for me it meant a lot to sit in a room and jive to the same dance song as somebody else."" Bhurji told Mashable that he began mixing different musical styles late in high school, when he couldn't resist adding tabla drum beats to a sample of ""Ms Jackson"" by Outkast. As a student at the University of California San Diego, Bhurji got his first taste of competitive bhangra from watching the UCSD team. ""People weren't really experimenting as much, and if you fast forward 10 years to today, people are experimenting like crazy,"" Bhurji says. ""It's a beautiful sort of evolution, but at that moment in time no one was really risking that. Everyone was coming from a much more traditional mentality."" Mixing for a dance team instead of his own entertainment gave Bhurji renewed accountability for the 16 other individuals relying on his skills. After he mixed for UCSD, other bhangra teams approached Bhurji for help with mixes, to give them a competitive edge. ""Sound gets stale. Experimentation is vital but at the same time it's really up to that artist or that DJ to put in that creative energy to make it stand out,"" Bhurji says. ""People are OK with having a dubstep segment in the middle of a bhangra routine, it's OK. It still has to be done creatively."" ""I think being different, being original and really just being excellent at what you'll do, that'll gravitate energy from all these other teams,"" Bhurji adds. ""At that time, it was just too early to know that this was something we can externally go out and tap into. All I was trying to do was just define a very strong identity for [my team] in a fusion world."" The 'Desi' Dance Network As Bhurji graduated and continued work as a DJ, the face of Indian American college dancing expanded enormously to include Bollywood and Western fusion. Competitions bring together students and teams from all over the country, and social media created a space to share their art. While Klasikhz was dropping tracks from San Diego, a college freshman named Srihari Sritharan was listening and learning from the East Coast. ""There was the South Asian show that every college has, and we had a freshman dance,"" recalls Sritharan, who now releases mixes as Dr. Srimix. ""I had the idea of 'Hey, what if we combine some songs here and there,' like make a nice, fluid mix for us to dance to. And that was the first mashup or remix that I'd made."" Sritharan joined Brown University's undergrad fusion team as a dancer, but creating new, interesting mixes was a crucial part of his tenure. ""I was already very aware that people are blending Indian and American culture in that way, but it was never - it was rarely, rather, that it was extremely integrated,"" he says. ""It was always kind of like, take some Indian instruments and put it underneath a Sean Paul song or Kanye/Ludacris song, that kind of thing."" Sritharan found that most mixes got stuck in a particular genre and didn't vary enough for an exciting dance experience. ""Either it was very DJ-style - meant for parties and 30 minutes long and straight bhangra, straight Bollywood, or EDM-heavy ... which I thought was not very great for dancing,"" he says. ""Or it'd be the complete opposite -- five consecutive songs with silence in between."" ""I really only started getting into the Indian fusion kind of music by listening to a lot of A.R. Rahman and just being so inspired by that,"" says Vissagan Gopalakrishnan, who DJs as VGo. Gopalakrishnan tried different musical instruments while growing up, such as the classical Indian harmonium, eventually experimenting with a keyboard in middle school and high school. ""There needs to be a unique organization of the music,"" he notes. ""At one point, overlaying two songs on top of each other just doesn't work out - almost all the time. There needs to be a lot of tweaking a lot of ways to give each song its own space and respect, but still being able to complement each other. It's a very imprecise science."" Sritharan guided Sajan Patel into the collegiate dance and music scene, where Patel was recruited to make a mixtape - a fusion mix designed to generate hype for upcoming dance competitions. ""Before I did the Infusion mixtape not many people had done EDM/Bollywood,"" Patel adds. ""That was like, Sanjoy ... but once he stopped doing things with the circuit, nobody else really did it, so I think that kind of brought it back. And now I see other DJs starting to do more EDM/Bollywood as well."" That word comes up a lot in these conversations: circuit. ""The circuit"" is the world of fusion dance, a world built by first-generation Indian Americans. There's the pervasive collegiate mindset among these young artists, because their work exists in a specific sphere. The dance ""circuit"" gave rise to fusion mixes, and though it thrives there, it's limiting in its own way. The 'side hustle' Bhurji is part of what you could dub the first wave of South Asian American DJs; he now works in advertising and continues to DJ and produce music. But he might be the exception; Sritharan is pursuing a Ph.D in neuroscience, while Gopalakrishnan and Patel are both planning for medical school. There's a reason that graduate school doesn't have its own dance circuit - it's not exactly known as an environment rife with free time. For the moment, Sritharan devotes his days to science and his evenings to music. ""I just know that while I have this momentum in music and remixing I should use it as much as possible,"" he says. ""This is so amazing where I just put a track out and everyone is eager to listen to it. That's something I would've never have imagined and I'm extremely thankful for it, but I do know that if I wait like five more years and no one knows me personally, this just becomes ... the spark is no longer there."" ""I really do try to use the music as a way to break from my school stuff,"" Gopalakrishnan agrees. ""Music mixes have really become part of who I am, so for me to sacrifice that for my medical career wouldn't be the best for me. It's something cool to talk about, too; I can talk to you about medicine, but people I talk to at my med school are like 'Oh, tell me about your music.' It makes me a more well-rounded person."" Patel started a DJ company with his friends in high school and was working events well before making mixes for a community of dancers and fans. With an approaching MCAT and more rigorous schoolwork, he may have to slow down the music. ""Most people don't see behind the scenes, what goes behind every gig and planning. You have to organize your equipment, organize people, understand what kind of crowd you're going to be DJing with,"" he explains. ""Once I get into med school ... I might just do mixes on SoundCloud rather than DJing live events because I doubt I'll have time. I feel like after med school it'll probably be a hobby, but honestly it just depends on where it goes."" ""I took an Uber to this one bar, and the Uber driver was so curious, and I played him some of my stuff and he shared it with some of his friends,"" Gopalakrishnan says. ""He messaged me about it, saying that he really did like my stuff. I think just by having live DJing or live mixing, that is definitely pulling in a different crowd."" SoundCloud and beyond If there's a particular obstacle in the way of this musical movement exploding past the undergraduate bubble, it's SoundCloud. Recently, the streaming platform began to remove specific tracks, sometimes shutting DJs' accounts down entirely. Sritharan has the perfect analogy: ""Imagine today if YouTube just disappeared. There are other video hosting sites out there, but to get everyone -- like a billion people -- to switch to a different site is not an overnight process,"" he says. ""It took a really long time for people to know that SoundCloud is the place to go for Indian remixes, and pretty much just as soon as that happened, SoundCloud started getting into legal trouble and shutting people down left and right."" ""I made a mix of 'Rude Boy' by Rihanna, and under fair use you can use like 10 seconds of it - I also completely changed the key and pitch - so I thought I would be totally fine,"" says Gopalakrishnan, whose account was recently shut down for a third time. ""I was aware that SoundCloud was doing this, but some bot took it down. Even Bollywood songs are being taken down -- Bollywood remixes that I thought would not be susceptible to these takedowns."" That brings up another development: Original Bollywood remixes. Popular Indian music producers began adding club beats to their own songs to package multiple versions on the original album.  It's partly a response to the American DJ movement and partly to supplant it with an Indian equivalent. The demand for more exciting musical styles makes losing a resource like SoundCloud even more disheartening. ""I'm not sure exactly how to bring it farther out,"" says Gopalakrishnan about spreading his music beyond its current niche. ""Right now the college scene is so tight as a community that it works really well to push music out there. I've been DJing some, more than I have, particularly over the past year, and by doing that I've gotten the word out about my mixes."" ""My really big hope is to kind of bring out like a new - to really push this to the next step, wherein it's the combination of Indian music with opera, or drum and bass,"" he adds. ""I'm working on a couple mixes where i'm trying to mix it with some African stuff as well, or Chinese stuff - so really trying to hone in on trying to share a new musical experience."" ""We're in a place in society, in our generation, where we have a lot more power than we think we do,"" Bhurji says. ""And music, dance, art - they are some of the most powerful things that we can do to bridge these confusing gaps that society has placed on us. We can do a wonderful job showing people we have more in common than we actually do. Music shows that. And for me that purity, that defines this hustle. That's incredibly inspirational for me."" Clearly, it's inspired a whole lot more. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

In addition to utilizing photos in their cards, users can also compare two 10-second side-by-side videos. Videos will auto-play and music can be muted for either video or played simultaneously. Regularly, the app gives users the ability to compare and vote on various trends by looking at side-by-side photos.  SEE ALSO: You can now buy your 'X-Men: Apocalypse' tickets on Snapchat For example, one 'card' will have photos of characters Aria and Spencer from Pretty Little Liars and ask users: ""Does Aria or Spencer have better style?"" They then choose their option, and see how others voted to the same question. Video was the next logical step for the platform, especially given the rise in competition from Snapchat, Instagram and other platforms that are more video-centric. ""Wishbone is a community, it allows teens to express their preferences and choices on music, celebrities, fashion, travel etc.,"" Jones told Mashable. ""Over the last year, we've been hearing a consistent request: 'when can we do video?'"" Jones said after conducting focus groups with teens, it became apparent there's a lot of insecurity happening on Instagram and other places. If photos don't get enough likes, teens remove them from their profile. The Wishbone app was created in 2014 by Science Inc, led by Michael Jones. Jones, the former CEO of Myspace, has spent the past four years at the helm of Science Inc., which is best known for incubating hit startups like Dollar Shave Club and DogVacay. Since launching, Wishbone has amassed more than four million monthly users across the U.S., a large majority of which are teens. Wishbone's audience is roughly 95 percent female, roughly 80 percent 18 to 13 year olds and 20 percent 19 to 25 year olds. Also announced: Wishbone's partnership with Disney's Freeform network (formerly known as ABC Family). The app will creative native mobile campaigns in conjunction with the channel's most popular shows, including Pretty Little Liars, Young & Hungry and The Fosters. Have something to add to this story?

It doesn't really matter, because we're all probably living in a simulated reality.  That's according to Elon Musk, who answered a question about the possibility of living in a simulated reality at the Code conference in California on Wednesday.  SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's craziest idea is the AI-beating Neural Lace The simulation hypothesis posits that every sufficiently advanced civilization is likely to create simulations of the universe (or a slice of it). And since there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe, each containing hundreds of billions of stars, there's a good chance that advanced civilizations other than ours exist, and that some of them are running a simulation of reality. Crunch the math a little, and you'll likely find that the chances of us not being in a simulation are rather small.  Or, if you trust Musk, insignificantly small. ""There's a one in billions chance that this is base reality,"" Musk said. He bases this argument on the fact that humanity has experienced amazing technological advancement in the last few decades.  ""Forty years ago, you had Pong, like, two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were. Now, 40 years later, we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously, and it's getting better every year (...) If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality.""  And he had thought this through. ""I've had so many simulation discussions it's crazy. In fact, it got to the point where basically every conversation was the AI/simulation conversation, and my brother and I finally agreed that we would ban such conversations if we were ever in a hot tub,"" he said.  If this sounds like a bleak proposal -- that humanity is basically an advanced version of The Sims -- do not despair. According to Musk, being in a simulation could be a good thing.  ""If civilization stops advancing, then that may be due to some calamitous event that erased the civilization. So maybe we should be hopeful that this is a simulation."" This is just one of many crazy really advanced ideas Musk laid out Wednesday. He also said he plans to send humans to Mars by 2024, and you should hear about his Neural Lace theory.

But now the feature is undergoing a big change that could better serve people in areas getting less media attention and relies more on people on the ground in those regions to help spread the word.  SEE ALSO: Facebook's first live-action VR film shows the power of 360 video Starting this week, Facebook is testing a Safety Check invite tool that allows people in affected areas to ask friends and family members to check in and mark themselves as ""safe"".  Before now, Facebook relied heavily on a team of on-call engineers to parse through real-time data about national disasters and incidents such as terrorist attacks coming in from third-party partners. Ultimately, these staffers would serve up manual Safety Check prompts encouraging people to use the feature. But the method was flawed; with hundreds of global issues happening in a short period of time, it was difficult for the tool to reach its full potential by relying solely on employees monitoring everything from afar. The move is a part of a greater effort to quickly (and accurately) spread whereabouts information and safety updates. To identify users in crisis zones, Facebook looks at the geo-location data of users based on where people are accessing the Internet (i.e. if you lived in Paris or accessed the Internet in the region during the 2016 terrorist attacks, the Safety Check alert populated at the top of news feeds).  But the new effort relies more on Facebook users talking about situations in affected regions. After serving them a prompt to use Safety Check, it will now provide an invite to encourage friends to check in as ""safe.""  Beyond relying on an algorithm, the tool has a better chance of getting in front of those people close to affected neighborhoods, rather than Facebook sending a prompt to everyone in an entire city. For example, if there's a fire in Manhattan and enough people are talking about it in the city, it will flag Facebook's Safety Check system. Facebook users who live in New York City may better know who works or lives in that area and can encourage them to use Safety Check.  The move is ultimately a part of a greater effort to quickly (and accurately) spread whereabouts information and safety updates by getting the whole community involved.  ""We needed an approach that could handle this range of population sizes with both accuracy and speed, but also remain rock-solid and ready to launch at a moment's notice,"" Peter Cottle of Facebook said in a statement. As Facebook ramps ups its frequency of pushing Safety Check out to users -- after all, there's been more disasters or terrorist attacks than the 28 total Safety Check prompts issued since its 2014 launch -- it needed a way for its system to the handle the influx, too. ""As our efforts ramped up, the team began solving the technical challenges associated with more consistent and frequent activations,"" Cottle added. ""In order to create a system that we can launch anywhere at a moment's notice, we scaled our infrastructure to handle larger events more efficiently and automated many of the manual steps previously required for activation."" But there are still limitations in the enhanced model -- in order to send a Safety Check request to someone, you have to be in the affected area (i.e. if you live in New York, you can't send a Safety Check request to your friend living elsewhere after a disaster strikes).  However, the move is a solid step forward for Facebook leveraging the power of its network to get more conversations around safety going in times of crisis.

Steph Curry vs. LeBron James -- or simply Curry vs. LeBron, so outsized are the profiles of the NBA's brightest stars.  Many saw this coming, an NBA Finals rematch between Curry's defending champion Golden State Warriors and LeBron's Cleveland Cavaliers. That's not a bad thing, though -- after nearly a year of tantric anticipation, the climax of the 2016 NBA season is finally here.  SEE ALSO: NFL star Patrick Willis is thriving in retirement as a Silicon Valley tech worker This year's NBA Finals tip off Thursday night at 9 p.m. EST. A decisive Game 7, if necessary -- and, by Jove, we hope it will be necessary -- is scheduled for June 19.  You can find full broadcast info below -- but first, let's examine five burning questions that will determine who ultimately hoists the Larry O'Brien NBA Championship Trophy later this month.  1. Can LeBron get a little help from his friends?  From left: J.R. Smith, LeBron James, Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love. Image: Tony Dejak/AP James was transcendent in defeat during last year's Finals, seemingly playing one-on-five while pushing the Warriors despite a severely depleted roster. Most of his teammates in last year's Finals were worthless, largely because deputy superstars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love missed the series with injuries.  Irving and Love are healthy now, and the Cavs breezed through the Eastern Conference playoffs. What's more, role players -- including, if you can believe it, J.R. Smith -- have excelled as well.  ""There's definitely a different feeling,"" James said this week. Love in particular is a major key-emoji to this year's Finals rematch. If he can be a presence inside while stretching the Warriors defense from three-point land, then Cleveland will be a very tough out.  James is playing in his sixth straight NBA Finals. That's an absolutely incredible individual achievement, but he'll need plenty of help from his teammates to finally deliver Cleveland its long-awaited title.  ""This city has been craving a championship,"" Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said after his team won the East. ""We have the right team and we have the right talent."" 2. Will fatigue slow the road-weary Warriors?  Everyone needs rest, after all. Image: Carlos Osorio/AP The Warriors set an NBA record with 73 regular-season wins this year. Their reward? A playoff gauntlet.  Oklahoma City pushed Golden State to the limit in a seven-game classic Western Conference Finals series. That followed a tough series against an upset-minded Portland team, and a first-round matchup against the talented Houston Rockets. What's more, Curry injured his knee in the Portland series, giving the Warriors a brief and terrifying glimpse of life without their superstar point guard.  SEE ALSO: Viva Shaun Livingston: Why Steph Curry's replacement is beloved by basketball fans The Cavs, by contrast, were never challenged in running through the remarkably feeble Eastern Conference. Will all that extra work catch up to the Warriors?  Dr. T.O. Souryal was the Dallas Mavericks' team physician for 22 years, including in 2011 when they won the NBA Finals (over LeBron's Miami Heat squad, coincidentally). He also twice served as president of the NBA Physicians Association.  ""Fatigue plays a role, there's no debate,"" Dr. Souryal told Mashable this week. ""There's also no denying that the NBA championship is the most demanding in sports, because the season is long and the post-season is long. You potentially have the discrepancy we are seeing now, where you have one team sweep the first two rounds and play relatively few playoff games, while the other team goes to a Game 7 and has to play several extra games.""  While mileage is a factor, there's no way to quantify or project its effects on this year's Finals. But teams with title hopes begin managing minutes and fatigue in training camp, according to Dr. Souryal, meaning both Golden State and Cleveland have been preparing to survive the full playoff slog for months.  ""A young team like Golden State, they've played a tremendous amount of minutes but they're still young players,"" Dr. Souryal says. ""It's not as big of an issue for them.""  With the NBA Finals' demanding whirlwind of media appearances, social media scrutiny and tremendous pressure, there is one thing players on both teams should prioritize above all else: rest.  ""That's the one thing they can't get enough of right now,"" Dr. Souryal says.  3. Can Cleveland slow Golden State's long-range bombers? Life is fun when you cannot miss. Image: Mark J. Terrill/AP Curry is by now widely acknowledged as the best shooter in NBA history. What's less talked about is that backcourt-mate Klay Thompson may well be the second-best shooter in NBA history.  Here's a stat for you: Thompson made 276 three-pointers this season. Only one player in NBA history has made more -- Curry, both this season and last.  The so-called Splash Brothers were at their wettest and deadliest while coming back from a 3-1 series deficit to beat Oklahoma City. In Game 6, Thompson hit a playoff record 11 three-pointers as Golden State evened the series. In Game 7, Curry erupted for 36 points, including seven three-pointers, to deliver the fatal blow.  There's no effective strategy for stopping both Curry and Thompson, but Cleveland must make them work to earn those lethal long-range looks. And yes, that's an obvious-ass statement -- but it's a critical factor nonetheless.  4. Can Andre Iguodala match his performance last year?  Your 2015 NBA Finals MVP. Image: Jeff Chiu/AP Last year's Cavs-Warriors series changed dramatically when Golden State coach Steve Kerr inserted Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of center Andrew Bogut. Iguodala's versatility sparked the Warriors on offense, and he hounded LeBron on defense. James shot just 38.1 percent from the floor when Iguodala was in, according to ESPN.  ""He was great the entire series. But he saved this season for us,"" Warriors star Draymond Green said after Golden State beat Cleveland last June. ""I always say Andre's a pro's pro. He's a professional guy, and it showed, and that's why he's the MVP of this series, and that's why we're champions."" Iguodala was equally important defending Thunder star Kevin Durant in Game 7 of the just-concluded Western Conference Finals, again coming up huge when it mattered most to his team.  As we mentioned earlier, LeBron's supporting cast has leveled up this time around. But Iguodala will be counted on to replicate last June's heroic defensive effort to limit the Cavs at their point of attack.  5. Who will protect home court?  An interesting question, indeed. Image: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP The Warriors are notoriously tough to beat at Oracle Arena in deep East Oakland. An April 2 loss to the Boston Celtics was their first home defeat in more than 14 months. Now they have home court advantage in the best-of-seven NBA Finals.  But there's hope for Cavaliers fans.  Before Boston's April 2 upset, Golden State's last home loss of any kind came in Game 2 of last year's Finals, when James delivered a Herculean stat line of 39 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists. So Cleveland knows it can win in Oakland -- with a depleted squad, no less.  In Golden State's favor: The team with home court advantage has won the past three NBA Finals. In Cleveland's favor: The last team to win the NBA Finals without home court advantage was LeBron's Miami Heat squad in 2012.  Let the games begin.

The Oscar-winning actress is producing and starring in a new educational series for preschoolers titled Julie's Greenroom.

And this is really a lovely culmination of all that I've wanted to do for a long time,"" Andrews tells USA Today. The series will feature guest stars like Alec Baldwin, Tituss Burgess, Carol Burnett, Idina Menzel, Josh Groban and more. The actress will not sing much herself on the show (her legendary voice was impaired after surgery in the late 1990s), but she might do ""little vaudevillian stuff,"" she tells USA Today. ""I leave the heavy singing to people like Idina and Giullian,"" she says.  The series does not yet have a specific release date, but will air in early 2017.  Have something to add to this story?

Villains throughout history are purposefully alluring, smart, sexy and chic. Their nefarious nature is manifested into their beautiful clothing. This is important for two reasons: It allows viewers to be drawn to these characters while also permitting them to hate on these villains because they are so beautiful.  Just look throughout cinematic or television history. The biggest villains of all time were style icons.  Cruella DeVille with her iconic look: designer furs, a penchant for chic, dark, bodycon frocks, and long, rouge-colored gloves.  There's Hannibal Lector, who still kept his grooming intact while behind bars (and in a straightjacket, for that matter!) The Joker, whose dazzling green hair matched with his royal purple suits, tailored so beautifully to his lanky body.  Even Malfoy's father, Lucius, had a dark, brooding sexiness to him. His platinum blonde hair had great volume and shine, for one. And his suits with fur trims, gold buttons, and excellent fit, were badass.  Draco's look? He's goofy, a hapless doofus, totally disarming.  Fine if you're meant to be the underdog.  Villains eschew normality, take disgust in blending in, and certainly embrace their weird. They're supposed to delight in their evil, celebrate their freak, take refuge in fun.  This Draco? He needs a hug. And a trim. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

Many reports of the meteor sighting appear to cluster around Arizona with some in California, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada and other states.  SEE ALSO: Extremely bright fireball in northern U.S. and Canada captured on video So far more than 140 reports of the meteor -- which appears to have flashed across the sky at about 4 a.m. local time -- have been submitted to the American Meteor Society (AMS). Some fireball videos (at least one of which is full of expletives) show that the flash of the meteor was so bright that it briefly made it as bright as day outside.  ""It was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed,"" LeAnn K. in Star Valley, Arizona wrote in a meteor report for the AMS.  ""It lit the area up as if it were daylight outside and it was only a sliver moon and pitch black out."" A heat map showing sightings of the fireball reported to the AMS.

Samsung's new Gear Fit 2 is an improvement on the original Gear Fit in every way. But it's not just better specs, the Gear Fit 2 is better in the meaningful ways that users will immediately appreciate, much like the Galaxy S7. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the sexy alternative to the iPhone 6S Plus Less smartwatch and more fitness band, the Gear Fit 2 still has a curved display and still looks hot as hell. The 1.5-inch (432 x 216) screen is smaller and wider compared to the Gear Fit's 1.84-inch (432 x 128) screen. The wider screen displays more on the new vertical interface (the Gear Fit launched with an awkward horizontal UI), which is more natural to look at and scroll through. Comes in three different colors. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE It's still a Super AMOLED display so it's power efficient and colors really pop. Like the Gear S2, the Gear Fit 2 is smartly powered by Samsung's own Tizen operating system this time around, and it looks and runs really well. Scrolling was smooth and the interface looked slick in my brief hands on time with it. Two band sizes: small and large. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE Gear Fit 2 fits smaller wrists better. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE The Gear Fit 2 also fits better on wrists. In addition to being thinner and lighter than the original, there are two different band sizes (small and large). While it's tough to tell in photos, the smaller band is contoured to be comfier on smaller wrists. Good job, Samsung. Gear Fit comes with a built-in GPS. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE The Gear Fit 2 has a built-in GPS. In addition to the heart rate sensor, accelerometer and gyroscope, the Gear Fit 2 has a built-in GPS. Now you can get real-time location data when you go for a run or bike ride without needing to connect it to a smartphone. The tracking data is also conveniently presented as a map, which you can then share to Facebook. The Gear Fit 2 is also smarter. A new auto-activity will automatically detect what kind of fitness activity you're doing after about 10 minutes and start tracking stats for it. A similar auto-sleep feature tracks sleeping data when you hit the sack. Integration with Samsung's S Health app means the Gear Fit 2 can sync with all your other measurable data like stress, weight and diet. Tracked data from third-party apps like Strava and RunKeeper can also be be synced to S Health and then with the Gear Fit 2 for a better overview of your health. The fitness tracker is IP68 water and dust-resistant. Samsung says the Gear Fit 2 can last up to 3 to 4 days of typical use. That's pretty good compared, and charging it is as easy as dropping it on a magnetic charging dock. New vertical UI is easier to scroll through. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE Comes with 4GB of storage for storing your own music. Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE Also awesome: internal storage. The Gear Fit 2 comes with 4GB of internal storage for you to stash your own music. It's another way Samsung's lessening the device's reliance on a smartphone connection. You can still use it to control music playback streamed from your phone, too. Gear Fit (left) and new Gear Fit 2 (right). Image: KEITH HOPKIN/MASHABLE I only got to poke around with the Gear Fit 2 for about an hour, but I really liked what I saw. It's sleeker, fits better, and the UI, GPS, music storage and advanced activity tracking features are big improvements over the original. The Gear Fit 2 will be available in three colors (black, blue and pink) for $179 and launch on June 10. Pre-orders start on June 3. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

As previously leaked, the Gear IconX are a pair of fitness-based earbuds. And again, they have no wires. SEE ALSO: The Apollo 7 earbuds finally bring you true, cable-free music Whereas the newly announced Gear Fit 2 is designed more for the health enthusiast -- the type of person who will wear it 24/7 -- according to Samsung, the IconX are aimed at ""casual exercisers."" That is, people who make a deliberate decision when they want to be active and when they want activity data. Priced at $199, the IconX are cheaper than other wire-free wireless earbuds like the $299 Erato Apollo 7's I recently reviewed. They'll be available in white, blue and black in Q3 of this year. As with the Gear Fit 2, I only got to try the earbuds for a couple of minutes. The earbuds are really light and fit snug in my ears, and I have small ears. Mashable chief correspondent Lance Ulanoff didn't have quite the same experience; he didn't find them comfortable. The earbuds will be several sizes of ear tips and ear gels for different ear sizes. Image: keith hopkin/mashable Similar to the Bragi Dash wire-free wireless earbuds, the IconX has a built-in heart rate sensor and sensors to track your distance and speed. 4GB of internal storage lets you store your own music for smartphone-free workouts. Connectivity with the S Health app lets you see all of your tracked health data in one place. Using the earbuds are straightforward and intuitive as far as I could tell. Each earbud has a touchpad on it. Tap once and to play/pause music and twice to skip the next track and three times to go back a track. Swipe up and down to adjust volume and hold down on it access the menu system and cycle through options. Carrying case also charges the IconX and holds two extra charges. Image: keith hopkin/mashable I listened to music stored on the earbuds and streamed from a phone and they sounded good in my opinion. I obviously can't tell you how well the connection and audio quality hold up during a workout yet, but the IconX look promising. One neat feature on the IconX is the ambient sound mode. Activate it and you'll still be able to listen to music, but you'll also be able to hear what's happening around you. Samsung says it's a safety feature for letting users hear traffic around them. It worked pretty well in my hands on. How you charge the earbuds' case and transfer music to the internal storage. Image: keith hopkin/mashable Like almost all wire-free wireless earbuds, losing them is a real concern. The IconX come with a case for storage, but it also doubles as a way to charge them. The case provides up to two additional charges for the earbuds, and it's used to transfer music files to the earbuds.  Battery life varies. The IconX will last 3.5 hours if you're listening to music stored on the earbuds themselves, but it drops dramatically to only 1.5 hours if you're streaming music from your phone. The IconX earbuds look and sound good, but I'll have to put them to a more rigorous test (and workout) when they become available before I can say if they're worth it or not.

But like, you had to know that from the headline, right? You know a show is grisly when you feel grateful that the director didn't make a fan favorite character's death too disturbing. In a Vanity Fair interview, the director of ""The Door,"" Jack Bender, revealed that Hodor's demise could have been even more disturbing than that of the Red Viper. So like, thanks are required, I guess? SEE ALSO: Meeting notes from our office's all-hands Kingsmoot Bender says that Hodor's flesh was going to be disturbingly torn from his body, as the undead are wont to do. I wanted to move in with the camera very slowly in one shot, eventually, of Hodor holding the door as those arms, those skeletal arms and the army of the dead, were overtaking him, pulling at his clothes and pulling at his flesh. And then of course, on that night I was working with the wonderful actor who plays Hodor and standing next to the camera, provoking him to get as emotional as he did while stuntmen were moving green arms around his face. Because as extraordinary and successful as shows like 'The Walking Dead' are, this show isn't that. Luckily, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss decided against the more gruesome death in favor of the classy, implied gruesome death that was shown in the episode. Bender went further with his description of what could have been in an interview with the Observer I talked about it with Dave and Dan a lot. I said, ""What the dead would be doing to Hodor would be ripping his clothes off once they got through that door. They would be ripping his flesh off. If the dead can go through wood, they're going to be tearing Hodor apart."" And they said something to me that really stuck. Which was ""If it's too horrific, we're not going to feel the loss of Hodor."" Good lord, Bender. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

Pop stars are weird, man. As a way of dealing with his oral fixation to help him quit smoking. It symbolizes his rebirth as he tries to find purpose in his life. Like all of us, he was very inspired by Vin Diesel's 2005 movie, The Pacifier. Instructions from his vocal coach. He genuinely doesn't know what pacifiers are for and thinks it's a cool accessory.

The global term to describe a group of people is thrown around town like it's going out of fashion. ""Hey guys,"" ""so guys,"" ""um, guys."" Guys, guys and more guys. In almost every context it is considered a gender-neutral term.  This hasn't stopped one man -- Australian of the year, no less -- from saying enough is enough. Using the term ""guys"" is an inherent gender bias that you need to rid yourself of, according to ex-Army chief David Morrison.  SEE ALSO: Spelling Bee champs are the stars of Amazon's latest ad campaign A new ad campaign by the Diversity Council Australia, for which Morrison is the chairman, has taken aim at the words we use in the workplace. It goes without saying that some of the offensive words mentioned in the ad -- which we won't repeat here -- should never be used in life, let alone the workplace.  ""It's a proven fact that more diverse workforces create more diverse thinking and are more productive, more effective,"" Morrison told the ABC. ""One way you can engender that kind of environment is to be careful about how you speak to other people, talking to them with respect and listening to their views with respect."" The campaign calls to attention our use of inappropriate language in the office, with one scene showing a woman calling a party ""gay"" and another where a group of women are referred to as ""girls."" All terrible ideas.  Unfortunately, on ABC News Breakfast, Morrison took his mission a step too far. Despite saying the Diversity Council is not trying to be the ""language police,"" he admitted he had stopped using the term ""guys"" in his everyday conversations and well, you should too. This is despite the majority of people assuming it as a gender-neutral term. ""I have removed that from my lexicon, as best I can. I think it is important,"" Morrison told the ABC.  ""These are little things but a lot of the research done by the diversity council has shown these tap drips of exclusive language, gender-based language, or inappropriate language has as much deleterious or disadvantaged effect as something where you're saying something blatantly inappropriate to another human being."" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and supporter of ""hey guys"" came to the party not long after. She said analysing the use of words such as ""guys"" was perhaps a step too far. ""I don't think we should try and interfere with the freedom of speech in this country to a point where people are too concerned about day-to-day conversations,"" she said. In good news, there is an Australian solution the rest of the world can learn from. Youse good with that?

It has also been christened with tomato sauce a.k.a. ketchup and dipped in beer, a journey that all Australian coins take.

LONDON -- Right, so let's get this straight once and for all.  Is Benjen Stark (i.e. the same Benjen Stark that has been missing from the show for a full SIX SEASONS, ever since he went trotting off beyond the wall back at the start of Season 1) -- is that Benjen Stark the same character as the mysterious ""Coldhands"" figure from George R. R. Martin's books? The same character that's been absent from the show so far, and who many assumed had been cut out? SEE ALSO: The pieces may be moving into place for another major battle on 'Game of Thrones' Well first, let's recap. Benjen Stark swooped in on horseback at the start of last Sunday's episode to rescue Meera and his nephew from all those pesky undead. He was wearing a hood and his face was covered. After he'd got them to safety and Bran was awake, he revealed his true identity and said something about how the Children of the Forest had revived him after he was attacked by the White Walkers (he didn't go into detail about what exactly he's been doing for the last six seasons, but maybe that's a story for another day). Coldhands, meanwhile, is a mysterious character who appears earlier in Martin's books and helps Bran and co. navigate their way through the land beyond the wall to track down The Three Eyed Raven. His real identity has yet to be revealed, but we do know that he's undead and that he can't pass beyond the wall. So are they the same character? Well, from the looks of this recent tweet from Isaac Wright (a.k.a. Bran), it seems likely. Welcome back Uncle Benjen, aka[?] (Geddit???) Total pleasure to have @realjosephmawle back on board. #GameofThrones -- Isaac.H.Wright (@Isaac_H_Wright) June 2, 2016 Those emoji don't lie. The evidence doesn't stop there, either. In this behind-the-scenes clip for episode 6, co-creator D.B. Weiss actually refers to the character as ""Coldhands Benjen."" So if Coldhands from the books is the same character as ""Coldhands Benjen"" from the show, why did George R. R. Martin explicitly deny this theory in the hand-written notes for his original A Dance with Dragons Manuscript? View post on imgur.com Seems like there are a couple of possibilities here: either Martin was lying to keep the return of a big character secret, or the show has gone off on another tangent. Maybe Benjen will return in the books, but as a separate character to Coldhands? It's always possible that the show could have merged the two characters into one and combined their storylines to save screen time. Ultimately, until The Winds of Winter hits the shelves, we know nothing. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

At the Code Conference in California on Wednesday, Musk reiterated one of his boldest claims to date, saying that, if all goes according to plan, SpaceX will start flying people to Mars by 2024, a more ambitious goal than any nation or private company has established.  SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's SpaceX plans to send people to Mars by 2024 Musk didn't give away too many details of the company's plan, saying that more Mars colonization plans will be revealed during a conference in September, but he did explain some of the reasoning behind SpaceX's audacious goal. Musk said: The basic game plan is we're going to send a mission to Mars with every Mars opportunity from 2018 onwards, and they occur approximately every 26 months. We're establishing cargo flights to Mars that people can count on for cargo, and it's like i said, the Earth-Mars orbital rendezvous is only every 26 months, so there's one in 2018, there'll be another one in 2020, and I think if things go according to plan, we should be able to launch people probably in 2024 with arrival in 2025. Just going off Musk's remarks, it's unclear if the 2024 mission is designed to have people orbit Mars or actually land there, but either way, it's an incredibly ambitious goal. Here are some reasons to be skeptical of SpaceX's plan. SpaceX hasn't flown a human to space So, here's the deal: It's 2016 and the company is aiming for a crewed mission to Mars in eight years, yet they haven't successfully sent a robot to Mars or even a human to orbit around the Earth.  With human missions comes a level of risk that SpaceX has not had to manage during its time in business. The company simply hasn't been put to the test in that way. SpaceX is expected to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA starting as soon as next year, so that will offer the firm an opportunity to introduce astronauts into their workflow and risk management programs. However, to go from those missions to human exploration of Mars in just seven years would be an astonishing feat. For now, it's difficult to see how a SpaceX-run humans-to-Mars mission might work out. ""Saying that they can reduce the risks adequately to start sending humans to Mars in the next ten years seems to me to be extremely bullish,"" said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in an interview. The interior of the crew-carrying Dragon capsule. Image: Spacex The fact is, no matter what, going to Mars is risky.  Only four space agencies have successfully landed robotic craft on or put spacecraft into orbit around Mars, so a private company aiming for that technically challenging ground is ambitious in a whole new way.  The company will attempt to drive down that risk as well as costs by sending an uncrewed Dragon capsule to Mars in 2018 and continuing to test out their methods every two years after that, but problems can always crop up.  History of broken promises Musk also has a history of making informal promises about timelines that don't pan out. ""They, and especially Elon in his individual pronouncements, have always been much more ambitious on things like schedule than what turned out to be the case,"" Logsdon added. In 2011, for example, Musk said that SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket -- a booster larger than the Falcon 9 that is in use today -- would fly by the end of 2012.  Four years later, the Falcon Heavy has yet to even be revealed to the media, though SpaceX is planning its first test flight for later this year. Artist's interpretation of a Falcon Heavy launch. Image: spacex A Mars mission could take up to $150 billion If SpaceX succeeds in their plan, the company will leap-frog over NASA in the race for Mars. But doing so will require a huge investment of the sort that even NASA is having trouble raising. NASA isn't planning on launching any kind of crewed mission to Mars until the 2030s. In all likelihood, it will take billions of dollars to actually get humans to Mars, and NASA is stumbling in its attempts to get the money needed for this kind of mission from Congress. Musk has yet to lay out a plan to fund his idea.  ""I've seen numbers anywhere between $80 [billion] and about $120 [billion] to $150 billion,"" Chris Carberry, CEO of Explore Mars, a non-profit founded to help send humans to Mars, told Mashable in an interview. ""I suspect he's [Musk] planning on doing it for a lot less."" It's possible that SpaceX will want to team up with NASA, other companies or different space agencies to make Musk's dream a reality. Lockheed Martin has proposed a possible architecture they could build in partnership with NASA that would put an orbital outpost around the red planet by 2028, in anticipation of a full landing in 2030. A Falcon 9 booster landed on a barge ship in the ocean on May 26, 2016. Image: SpaceX SpaceX's funding and design architecture will remain a mystery until Musk presents his ideas more formally in September, but there's a chance SpaceX's plans may dovetail nicely with NASA's or even Lockheed Martin's planning. ""A smart company would not ignore sources of expertise, and most of the expertise in the world on landing on Mars resides at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory], resides at NASA,"" Logsdon said.  Of course, with government involvement comes possible slowdowns and less freedom for companies seeking to do something ambitious, but that might be a trade-off Musk and SpaceX are willing to take. Myriad of technical challenges Perhaps the most compelling reason to be skeptical is the technological barriers that need to be overcome before any humans board a SpaceX capsule bound for Mars' rust-colored surface. The company will need to develop a new kind of spacecraft, according to Musk, for the half-year trip to Mars. SpaceX's Dragon Version 2 is about the size of an SUV and is built to transport humans to the International Space Station, but it won't be a very comfortable astronaut hangout on a long journey to another planet.  The company still needs to work out the kinks of its 2018 mission before any human-rated craft can be flown. In addition, SpaceX still doesn't have a sure-fire method for safely landing cargo -- or people -- on the red planet, a major hurdle of any Mars mission. Building and testing a new space system isn't easy, and one of the biggest challenges SpaceX will face on its road to Mars is creating a life support system capable of keeping astronauts alive on the way to and from the red planet.  Artist's conception of a Dragon entering Mars' atmosphere. Image: spacex ""Our experience right now has been on the International Space Station, and that is constantly being repaired, and is constantly getting supplies from Earth, so this is many orders of magnitude more complicated,"" Carberry said.  ""I hope he can really speed things up and motivate everyone else, but I'd be really shocked if he could actually get people alive and back on Mars in 2024,"" he said of Musk's aspirations. No matter what, technologically, SpaceX will need to have a near-perfect testing record in order to make it to Mars on such an ambitious time-scale. As it is, the company doesn't have a perfect record.  In June 2015, a Falcon 9 rocket built by SpaceX disintegrated in the skies above Florida just after launching with an uncrewed Dragon capsule carrying supplies for the Space Station. Every new space program has growing pains, and there's no reason to think that SpaceX's will be any different. Those rocket landings though  Since he founded SpaceX in 2002, Musk has been aiming for Mars.  ""Mr. Musk has been very explicit since starting business that he would create successful space business to get to Mars,"" Logsdon said. In fact, the entrepreneur has often said that he would be willing to die on the red planet, as long as it's not on impact.  So, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the company is putting its Martian ambitious into high gear now.  A SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on Mars. Image: spacex ""Elon is a smart person,"" Logsdon said. ""He has smart people working with him, whatever plan they have come up with is not going to be harebrained; it's going to be executable."" Although SpaceX has a long way to go before getting people to Mars, it isn't like the company is sitting around doing nothing.  In a bit more than 10 years, the company has become a world-class launch provider.  SpaceX is also in the process of making good on another promise, landing four different boosters back on Earth after delivering payloads to space. This allows them to drastically lower the costs of reaching various Earth orbits. ""He has made very ambitious announcements before, and he kind of lives up to what he says, and I have a lot of faith and optimism in what they're doing, and I think it's going to be interesting to see if they beat NASA to Mars,"" Commercial Spaceflight Federation president Eric Stallmer told Mashable."

Their latest obsession: a legal dispute between a ""hated"" parkour/pickup artist and a husband-and-wife team whose thing is to critique others' videos. In this case, the pickup artist (Matt Hosseinzadeh, or MattHossZone, aka ""The Bold Guy,"" 175,000 subscribers) says Ethan and Hila Klein (aka H3H3 Productions, 2 million subscribers across two channels) used too much footage from one of his ""Bold Guy"" videos in their takedown. Now, not only are lawyers involved, but Team Internet is taking sides, too. And it's not just because they're no fans of ""The Bold Guy"" -- they believe fair use across the YouTube universe is at stake. Since the Kleins announced that they were being sued (see the video, above), thousands have donated more than $166,000 to a GoFundMe campaign -- created by outspoken YouTuber Philip DeFranco -- to H3H3's cause.  The duo declined Mashable's interview requests, but they've been posting their gratitude online. Hosseinzadeh, a 38-year-old from Sherman Oaks, Calif., told Mashable in an email interview that he took legal action after he noticed the video back in March.  ""Initially I emailed the Kleins to ask them to remove my content from their video,"" he said in an email. ""They rejected my request and told me to contact their lawyer if I don't like it. I had to then hire a lawyer to continue the conversation. The Kleins have circulated this story where my lawyer appears out of the blue making demands, but that simply was not the sequence of events."" Hosseinzadeh maintains his copyright claim, arguing that the Kleins 13-minute comedy segment ""used a majority"" of his work, including the original music, dialogue and the choreography. ""You can essentially watch my film by watching their video,"" he said. ""That frustrates the entire point of copyright. Critiquing or commenting on a film should not, and almost always does not, use virtually the entire work."" The YouTuber filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Federal Court last month, but news of the suit only became public knowledge after H3H3 informed their 2 million subscribers on their two channels.  The duo, who have been uploading videos for the last three years, have published more than 300 comedy videos, and bring in about $6,00 a month in crowd-funded donations in addition to their YouTube revenue. They argue that the lawsuit would burden them financially, but could also set a poor precedent in the video sharing community when it comes to copyright claims. According to the lawsuit, the Klein's controversial video was removed from their YouTube page after their counterclaim was denied because of pending litigation. 'The most hated guy on the Internet' But Team Internet has already cast Matt Hoss as their villain.  One Imgur user even called him ""the most hated guy on the Internet."" Image: imgur Others have poked fun at him (or called him far worse insults) on Twitter. Matt Hoss aka Bold Guy is a total jerk for suing h3h3. As if you couldn't tell from watching his stupid videos. #MattHossZone #sleazebag -- Eric Lightman (@Elightman) May 25, 2016 MattHoss was taken aback by all the backlash, particularly what he views as skewed media coverage.  ""They are saying I sued the Kleins because they criticized me which couldn't be further from the truth,"" he said. ""I've been harshly criticized for years, it's part of the business, for me, This lawsuit is strictly about the unauthorized, excessive use of my work ...The Kleins aren't fighting for fair use, they're fighting for themselves."" ""The Kleins aren't fighting for fair use, they're fighting for themselves."" Hosseinzadeh's lawyer, Tim Bukher, said the Internet has wrongfully turned him into a bully. ""He has not received any outreach for his side of the story which has been distorted by the only side that the news media has bothered to consult,"" Bukher said. Why Team Internet cares But why exactly are YouTubers so heated over this seemingly minor lawsuit?  Because fair use has arguably become the hot button issue among YouTubers, especially in the last year. Many feel YouTube has a broken copyright system, because it legally protects itself but puts users at risk. SEE ALSO: YouTube wants to make it easier for creators to make money while fighting copyright claims Just a few months ago, The Fine Brothers learned this lesson the hard way after announcing they were going to trademark their ""react"" reaction videos. The Internet lost its collective mind, and the Fine Bros. lost 2 million subscribers.  As a result, the creative duo apologized -- and discontinued the program. Video: Kayvan Ghavim YouTube has its own content detection system known as Content ID, which helps rights holders to identify content that is comprised partially or entirely of their intellectual property and manage or monetize it. But complaints over how YouTube handles copyright as a whole have become increasingly common, and YouTube says it's been working to improve its support system. In November, YouTube pledged financial and legal resources to help combat unwarranted copyright claims and takedown notices. In April, YouTube also announced it will roll out a new system that will help creators earn revenue even as a Content ID claim is being disputed. ""We strongly believe in fair use and believe that this improvement to Content ID will make a real difference,"" YouTube said in a recent blog post. ""We're also paying close attention to creators' concerns about copyright claims on videos they believe may be fair use. We want to help both the YouTube community and copyright owners alike better understand what fair use looks like online.""

Because of this can-do attitude, kids starting their own businesses are having the kind of success some adults can only dream about. We could all learn a thing or two from these mini moguls. Here are the three biggest business lessons for grown-ups from the kidtrepreneurs who are beating them at their own game. #1 - Start where you are For many kids, their first foray into business is the simple lemonade stand, selling the sweet treat to neighbors passing by from the comfort of their own front yard. When starting your business, don't get overwhelmed by where you want to end up. Instead, focus on the here and now. Take a cue from the kids and start small, right where you are. No one knows this lesson better than Mikaila Ulmer (above), the 11-year-old owner of Me & the Bees Lemonade (previously known as BeeSweet Lemonade). Ulmer started her company when she was just four years old, finding inspiration in her grandmother's sugar-free recipe that uses honey as a natural sweetener. After starting small, Ulmer has been able to grow her company and compete on the shelves with the likes of big name brands. Just this year, Me & the Bees Lemonade inked an $11 million distribution deal with Whole Foods. #2 - ""No"" is not a closed door While facing setbacks both large and small, look for opportunities to move forward rather than getting caught up in the disappointment. When 14-year-old Moziah ""Mo"" Bridges appeared on Shark Tank, all five investors passed on his bespoke bowtie enterprise Mo's Bows. But Bridges, who was 11 at the time, didn't let this setback stop him from continuing with his dream. (Watch the complete segment in the video below.) Five years later and business is still going strong for the Memphis native, who dreams of attending Parson's School of Design in New York City and starting his own clothing line. And though his turn on TV didn't land him a deal, it did introduce him to his mentor, none other than fellow shark Daymond John. #3 - Look for a partner who shares your goals Working with a partner can help keep you motivated - and from burning out. For many kids, that partner may mom and dad, or even a sibling. The idea is to partner up with someone who has the strengths you lack and could use an extra boost from your skills. It's all about being a team. When it comes to their financial responsibility education business Champions of Change, brothers Jeremiah (10) and Joshua West (7) have had each other to lean on as they penned their book and attend speaking gigs. For 8-year-old Kiowa Kavovit (above), the pint-sized inventor behind the paint on bandage company Boo Boo Goo, the ultimate partner was her very own dad. An inventor in his own right, Andrew Kavovit recognized the genius behind his daughter's idea and helped her bring it to life with the help of a team of wound care specialists."

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5751e43cd48d08060a3329df"	"This alarm helps pregnant women find a seat on mass transit"	"Mashape"	""	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7pFGgpGhGs/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"http://feeds.mashable.com/~r/Mashable/~3/x5vGQNaWqnA/"	"5751e696d48d08062463b98f"	"The flooding in Paris is so severe, people are swimming down streets"	"Mashape"	"Water continues to rise in Paris, where the River Seine has swollen so much that people are swimming through city streets.

Metro lines, too, have been disrupted by the floodwater.  The French Environment Ministry has said more evacuations may take place in towns outside of Paris that sit along the river. The heavy rains are the result of a slow-moving low pressure system that has kept igniting powerful thunderstorms day-after-day.  The recent rains have come on top of an unusually wet May. According to Meteo France, in Ile-de-France, this May was the wettest on record, with rainfall totals coming close to the record high for any month, which was set in December 1999.  The agency said that three months of rain fell between May 29 to 31 across parts of the country. Climate studies show that globally and throughout Europe, heavy precipitation events have become more common as a result of human-caused global warming. This, combined with increased development in flood plains, can worsen flood events. In Europe, record-breaking rains increased 31% during the 1980 to 2010 period when compared to the previous 80 years, according to a study published in 2015.  Andrew Freedman contributed reporting.

Update from @UnionPacific on #oiltrain derailment in Mosier pic.twitter.com/t4hldrnTca -- Tony Schick (@tonyvschick) June 3, 2016 The accident happened around noon near the town of Mosier, about 70 miles east of Portland. Eleven rail cars from a 96-car crude oil train derailed, according to a statement from Union Pacific Railroad.  No injuries have been reported. About 200 students were evacuated from an elementary and middle school near the scene. Interstate 84 was closed for a 23-mile stretch between The Dalles and Mosier and the radius for evacuations was a half-mile. Silas Bleakley was working at his restaurant in Mosier when the train derailed. ""You could feel it through the ground. It was more of a feeling than a noise,"" he told The Associated Press as smoke billowed from the tankers. Bleakley said he went outside, saw the smoke and got in his truck and drove about 2,000 feet to a bridge that crosses the railroad tracks. There, he said he saw tanker cars ""accordioned"" across the tracks.

He, too, drove to the bridge overpass to look down and saw the cars flipped over before a fire started in one of the cars and he called 911, he said. ""The train wasn't going very fast.

On Thursday, Japanese soldiers discovered a boy left on a mountainside road 6 days earlier. The child was found safe, but local officials warned that he could have easily been devoured by bears. Just a few days before that, a toddler wandered into a gorilla cage at the Cincinnati Zoo. Zoo officials were forced to shoot the gorilla while the child was stuck between the animal's legs. And while there were multiple parties responsible for each trauma, social media targeted their heartfelt rage on one particularly familiar group: the parents. SEE ALSO: Animal rights activists react to gorilla killing after child fell into zoo enclosure It's easy to see why. For the past week, hundreds of Japanese rescue workers have been combing the forest in search of the grotesquely adorable 7-year-old Yamato Tanooka. Yamato's parents had left him for several minutes on a mountainside road last Saturday after they caught their child throwing rocks at cars and people. The punishment was only supposed to be temporary -- their initial plan was to leave him beside the road to scare him, and return a short while later. But when the parents finally returned, it was too late. Yamato was gone, lost in a sparsely populated woods known for its very hungry bears. It would be almost a week before soldiers found him. And even though he was found safe -- dehydrated and malnourished, but safe -- the initial chances for his survival were slim.   Image: youtube All across the Internet, social media fingers were hard at work, busy tweeting, pointing, and feverishly wagging.  ""This isn't discipline, it's child abuse,"" Kenichiro Mogi, a neurologist and media personality, wrote on Twitter on Monday.  ""If your children get on your nerves, don't worry, that's normal. What isn't normal is to abandon your child in a forest as a punishment,"" the Italian newspaper Viaggi News shared in an editorial. ""The parents are so stupid that I am speechless,"" another Twitter user wrote. Just heard about poor little Yamato Tanooka, absolutely heartbreaking  Those stupid parents! -- Tor thatspeachy (@tornumber9) May 30, 2016 Horrible parents! Hopefully he is found #YamatoTanooka https://t.co/2CDezCQQrf -- Meril C (@meril_c) May 31, 2016 The word 'abandoned' appeared in multiple headlines, across legacy news outlets: CBS, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and yes, Mashable. This, even though the parents had never fully abandoned him -- left him unattended for several minutes, even neglected him -- but never seemingly planned to give up their custody. The word 'abandoned' appeared in multiple headlines, across legacy news outlets. Despite the extremism of their language, social media was (at least) partially correct. Yamato's parents are responsible for him, and they did leave him in a physically dangerous and emotionally unsafe situation. One of the greatest psychological threats a parent can direct at a child is that of abandonment -- and Yamato's parents, well, made it. Yamato's father made a videotaped apology to the public, who cast themselves as the victims in this situation, and social media responded the way any parent would. They either thanked them for their apology, or continued as before, as if they hadn't listened at all.  Social media had done its favorite job: parenting the parents.  Only a few days earlier, parents in Cincinnati Ohio faced a similar wrath when their child walked into a gorilla cage. A petition with close to 500,000 signatures called for child protective services to investigate Michelle Gregg, the child's mother. Here, the shaming seemed even more vitriolic, more disproportionate -- perhaps because the tragedy hit closer to home. Social media users are more likely to identify with a parent who's distracted at a zoo than a parent who consciously leaves their child at the woods. The closer the danger, the more familiar the details, the more likely we are to strike out.  As culpable as the parents were, some of the web's rage felt unwarranted, compulsive, self-serving. Parents are expected to be stoic superhuman god-creatures, above feeling and rage and retribution. Think back to a time when either you as a parent, or your parents, made a similar error with lesser consequences. Spent too much time looking at your phone while your kids played unsupervised on a crowded playground. Lost your temper and said something spiteful, something you'll always regret. Sped away from the people you cared most about.  Sure, none of this is to excuse what Yamato's parents did. Their actions, however familiar, unintentionally put their child at mortal risk. But the difference between Yamato's parents and most good parents is conceivably minor and probably luck.  Just last year readers were put in similar situation, asked to pick sides in a fight that's honestly too embarrassing to type. In a small diner in Portland, Maine, parents found themselves unable to silence their toddler, who had waited close to 40 minutes for pancakes. The restaurant owner proceeded to kick the family out, a Facebook war ensued, and Americans everywhere were forced to choose sides in the one of the most meaningless battles of 2015. Yet the rage directed at the parents of the toddler hungry for the pancakes and the boy lost in the woods in Japan was almost identical. Self-righteous fury hath no patience for context or nuance, no appetite for reflection or carbs. Nothing produces endorphins quite like a quick hit of righteousness.  Self-righteous fury hath no patience for context or nuance. But that doesn't mean that we as readers and viewers can't act with more compassion. Instead of pointing fingers, raise hands to help. Hold actors accountable, and reflect on our own failures. Consider the nuances of the situation, or simply (the horror!) refuse to say anything at all. Image: kyodo/ap Asking social media to practice empathy is the definition of a losing battle. Still, as these incidents become more and more public, and our comments' sections longer and longer, it's worth attempting. Otherwise, we'll find ourselves stuck in the middle of a Facebook war, fighting with some third-rate relative about some second-rate zoo's right to bear arms. We may even end up defending our ""real opinion"" about pancakes standards in small city diners. Or tweeting hate at parents at like Yamato's, parents who display earnest grief and pain, parents we don't know and never will. We'll abandon our good-enough parents, who deserve our censure as much as our compassion, on a lonely street in a dark woods -- then leave it to them to find a way out.

On Thursday afternoon, influencers, --including Baddie Winkle, The Betches, F!ck Jerry and Beige Cardigan -- cast members like Ally Maki, Asif Ali and Zach Cregger and media arrived at the island. Beach life was bliss (as it is when you know you're going home). The first episode preview, a nerve-racking affair for cast and crew who can detect a courtesy laugh from a mile away, reeled in legitimate LOLs. When Friday rolled around things got weird in the best way possible at a beach event where cast member Brian Sacca indulged in a massage, Baddie Winkle mastered the art of giant beer pong and cast member Asif Ali was taught how to slingshot fruit. A storm put the squad indoors momentarily, but the fun continued into the wee hours at a #GetWrecked bash that saw a DJ in a post-crash airplane cockpit. Drinks flowed, cameras flashed. A little worse for wear, the island crew of internet stars headed home before the realized they forgot something pretty important: Correspondent and comedian Marina Franklin. We have footage of Marina's last moments with civilization in the video above and have received confirmation that there are plans to get her home before the Wrecked TBS premiere on June 14 (if nothing else did, waiting for the second episode would break her spirit completely).  Until then, Marina is waiting; bored and with little means of communicating with the outside world. Thankfully, we have a plan to keep her entertained: The message in a bottle. Over the next two weeks we will be live streaming on the Mashable Entertainment Facebook page with the stranded stand-up comedian. Questions posted on Twitter with the hashtag #GetWrecked and in the live feed comments will be sent to Marina via a message in a bottle. Some of those will make it, others will inevitably sink.

Ali passed away Friday evening, according to a family spokesperson. He was admitted to a Phoenix-area hospital Thursday with respiratory issues. Reports emerged Friday that Ali's condition was serious enough to draw family members to his bedside. So ended a remarkable life defined by athletic excellence, social consciousness and independent thinking. Parkinson's disease diminished Ali physically after he was diagnosed in the 1980s, but he remained luminous in the American consciousness. He was a vocal objector to the Vietnam War, a heavyweight champ as entertaining as he was punishing, and an athlete who consumed American political and popular culture like no one before or since. Born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., on June 17, 1942, Ali grew up in the segregated South. When Ali was 12 years old, his father, a commercial painter, gave him a new bicycle. The bike was promptly stolen, and the young Ali was livid. He told a police officer named Joe Martin that he'd love to beat up the thief if he could track him down. ""You better learn to fight before you start fightin',"" Martin replied, according to his 1996 New York Times obituary.  Martin began teaching the boy to box. The world hasn't been the same since. 1962. Image: Dan Grossi/AP Two years later, Ali won a Golden Gloves tournament for beginners. Three years after that, he won the Amateur Athletic Union's national title. But it wasn't until the 1960 Olympics that Ali -- still an amateur, still known as Cassius Clay -- broke through.  In Rome that summer, he beat Poland's Zbigniew Pietryzkowski for the gold medal. The 6-foot-3 American teenager's talent and charisma -- relentlessly chatting up other athletes at the Olympic Village -- hinted at more glory to come.  After returning home with his gold medal, Ali turned pro and began transforming into the athlete who would captivate a nation. He won his first 19 professional fights to set up a 1964 showdown with heavyweight champion Sonny Liston.  In the lead-up to the fight, Ali talked trash and posed for a silly photo shoot with an up-and-coming band called The Beatles. Despite being a heavy underdog, Ali beat the champ by TKO. ""I don't have a mark on my face, and I just upset Sonny Liston and I just turned 22 years old!"" Ali exclaimed in a post-match interview that included poetry from the champ and is still the stuff of legend. ""I must be the greatest!"" Ali was also keenly perceptive from a young age about how he fit into America's ugly racial history. ""A southern colored boy has made $1 million just as he turns 22,"" Ali wrote in a first-person Sports Illustrated piece just before he fought Liston. ""I don't think it's bragging to say I'm something a little special."" While climbing the boxing ranks, Ali had been doing something else as well: Developing an interest in Islam, and a friendship with a young activist named Malcolm X. Soon after his upset victory, Ali announced that he had joined the Nation of Islam and took the name Muhammad Ali. Ali and Malcolm X in New York City, 1964. Image: Associated press Ali would box many, many more seminal matches in his career. A partial list: His 1965 rematch with Liston, which produced the iconic shot of Ali standing over his vanquished foe in victory; his three clashes with Joe Frazier; and his 1974 fight with George Foreman in Zaire, better known as ""The Rumble in the Jungle.""  But after beating Liston, joining the Nation of Islam and taking the name Muhammad Ali, the kid from Louisville would never again be just a sports story. By 1967, Ali was a full-on celebrity. Meanwhile, the Vietnam War was ablaze and the draft was forcing young men to go fight. That April, Ali refused to be inducted into the U.S. Army. This cast him as a hero to the anti-war movement and the counterculture of the time. To many others, it cast him as a villain, an anti-American draft-dodger.  Ali speaks at an anti-war demonstration at the University of Chicago in 1967. Image: Charles Harrity/AP When pressed to express why he refused to go fight in Vietnam, Ali delivered one of his most immortal quotes: ""I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong. Ain't no Viet Cong ever called me nigger."" Ali was convicted of draft evasion that June. A legal saga followed. It ascended all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but Ali ultimately prevailed in 1971. Ali's political activism increased during that period, paralleling a national period of civil rights and anti-war restlessness. But he'd been stripped of his heavyweight title and effectively banned from the sport for three years. A comeback was in order. Ali stands over Foreman at ""The Rumble in the Jungle."" Image: Associated press Ali worked his way back into championship form, and in 1974 finally regained the heavyweight title after beating Foreman in Zaire. That fight showcased Ali at his most audacious in the ring, leaning back on the ropes and deflecting or dodging blow after blow from Foreman.  Ali let Foreman punch himself into the mat, egging him on with histrionics and trash talk the whole time, then calmly dispatched him in the eighth round. The cheeky strategy was dubbed the ""rope-a-dope."" The term has lived on since as a colloquialism for taking advantage of suckers of every stripe.  Ali beat Frazier in their third and final epic clash, 1975's ""Thrilla in Manila,"" but his career tailed off from there. Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1984; the disease's onset in his early 40s is believed to be linked to his fighting career. Ali remained a public figure while battling Parkinson's, continuing to champion civil rights and other causes. He also became an active philanthropist, establishing the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center in Phoenix. In 1999, both Sports Illustrated and the BBC named Ali their sportsman of the century. Ali on a book tour in 2004. Image: Dan Grossi/AP Generations of sports fans have been raised with only stories and grainy footage of Ali's boxing heyday. But for many of those fans, another image endures.  Ali -- his left arm visibly trembling due to Parkinson's -- lifted his right hand in Atlanta in 1996 before lighting the torch for that year's Summer Olympics. Shaking, he struggled momentarily, but finally the flame caught.  There the legend stood, just as he did in the ring, and in the tumultuous social arena of the 1960s: challenged but unbowed."

Sometimes, it can prove a fatal one. SEE ALSO: Rev up your ride with this electric-powered front wheel In fact, 432 cyclists were seriously injured or killed on London roads in 2014, according to Transport for London figures.  Tech company Hovding wants to turn London into a ""cycle-friendly city"" by giving cyclists ""Flic"" smart buttons to mark traffic hazards while sending emails to the mayor of London at the same time. Five hundred buttons have been distributed to members and supporters of the London Cycling Campaign, who are campaigning for better conditions for cyclists in the city.  The button is connected via Bluetooth to the cyclist's phone using the Flic app. As soon as the cyclist presses the button, data is collected from the cyclist's location and added to a map on the campaign website. The map is designed to mark hazards and raise awareness of just how many unsafe streets and junctions there are in the capital.  ""More people should be able to cycle and feel safe while doing so, but today's infrastructure doesn't allow it. Therefore, we would like to highlight the issue and push forward the campaign for safer cycling, letting cyclists themselves to report about the places that need improving,"" Anna Katarina Skogh, marketing director at Hovding, said in a statement.  But, that's not all the button does.  Each time cyclists press one, an email is sent to the mayor of London to make him aware of the extent of the perils cyclists face. In a statement, Hovding said that the emails to the mayor are designed to ""encourage him to keep his promise to 'make London a byword for cycling.'"" This email will be hitting Sadiq Khan's inbox pretty regularly. Image: Hovding During his campaign, London's new mayor, Sadiq Khan, outlined a range of policies to make cycling safer in London.  ""I know we've made a lot of progress as a city but there is still more to do if we are to protect cyclists from collisions, and to encourage more people to take up cycling as a way of getting around the city,"" Khan told the Guardian.  ""By committing to the London Cycling Campaign's Sign for Cycling pledges, the new Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has promised to make cycling in London safe and enjoyable for everyone,"" Amy Summers, campaign coordinator at London Cycling Campaign, said in a statement.  She added, ""The 500 Londoners giving him a beep will hopefully remind him to get on with fulfilling those pledges, as a matter of urgency."" Have something to add to this story?

It's not too difficult to figure out if you want to do it yourself, but if you want to run Android on your iPhone, you'll need to do more than install some software. SEE ALSO: Here's what the 'i' in iPhone means The accomplishment of mashing together the two smartphone rivals was achieved by Tendigi CTO Nick Lee, who created a custom app and case to run Android Marshmallow on an iPhone 6 Plus.  Thanks to the open-source nature of Android, Lee was able to get a HiKey LeMaker Android development board and modify it to run Android through a USB/lightning port connection. From there, he hooked up the board to a battery powerful enough to power both the Android board and the iPhone, and put the setup in a 3D-printed case. The 3D-printed case containing the Android development board and battery. Image: nick lee/tendigi Instead of actually running Android on the iPhone, the iPhone is effectively being used as a surrogate display for the Android board. It runs through an app, and while it isn't the smoothest version of Android and doesn't quite fit the screen size, it looks like it works pretty well in action. SEE ALSO: Apple Watch hack lets you put Windows 95 on your wrist To switch back to iOS all you have to do is press the home button, which is pretty convenient. This isn't Tendigi's first attempt to put an OS where it doesn't belong. In April, Lee managed to get an Apple Watch to run a miniature version of Windows 95, which shows just how little resources older computers required to run 20 years ago. While the iPhone/Android case and app combo make for a pretty cool mashup, they are not currently for sale, although someone with a lot of knowledge in the area can check out Lee's blog post and work it out on their own. For the rest of us though, we'll just have to choose between the two smartphone OS giants. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

SEE ALSO: Michael Bay tweets picture of new 'Transformers' Bumblebee Chevrolet released a strength comparison test Wednesday morning of its Silverado pickup versus its chief competitor, the Ford F-150. Specifically, the tests scrutinized the durability of the trucks' beds. While the Chevy's bed is constructed from roll-formed, high-strength-steel, the F-150's bed is made from stamped aluminum. Though aluminum is lightweight, which aides in the Ford's fuel efficiency, it's also less resilient than steel. In spite of this, Ford has claimed its military-grade aluminum bed met or exceeded durability testing. Chevy begged to differ. In both laboratory testing and 26 real-world and demonstrations, Chevy quite literally punched holes in Ford's resiliency claims. Image: Chevrolet With little more than a 28-pound toolbox, Chevy put 13 holes in a 2016 F-150's bed. In the same tests, the 2016 Silverado suffered two punctures. Stepping the tests up a notch, Chevy dropped 55 landscaping blocks from a height of five feet into the trucks. Over the 12 tests, the Ford's bed was punctured 52 times. During the same tests, the Silverado suffered zero punctures. At this point, I am sure there are Ford employees having aneurisms somewhere in Dearborn, Michigan. Certainly, Chevy picked tests that it knew would highlight its strengths and Ford's weaknesses. Accordingly, this demo needs to be viewed with a grain of salt. That said, it's a pretty striking test. Twenty-eight pounds isn't an exceptionally heavy item, so we'd expect a truck bed to be able to handle that kind of drubbing. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, sea ice extent across the Arctic was 4.63 million square miles, which was an astonishing 224,000 square miles below the previous record low for the month of May, set in 2004.  Compared to the 1981-2010 average, sea ice extent was a whopping 537,000 square miles below average. To put this another way, this means that the Arctic was missing a chunk of sea ice that was twice the size of the state of Texas. SEE ALSO: Arctic sea ice set a record low every single day in May ""I think people have a hard time getting a grasp on how big a loss this is,"" NSIDC director Mark Serreze told Mashable in an interview. ""This is a lot of real estate."" The sea ice record occurred after record lows were also set in January, February and April, following a record warm winter throughout large parts of the Arctic that surprised even veteran climate scientists. This is fine. First off the chart, then off the page. A testament to this year's #Arctic warmth... pic.twitter.com/TVSuStnn1P -- Zack Labe (@ZLabe) June 8, 2016 ""We're losing ice in all seasons now. And what happened, why we are where we are for this May, so very low, is very clearly a reflection of how absurdly warm it was over the Arctic all winter and into the spring,"" he said. In a press release on Tuesday, the NSIDC said that ""an unusually early retreat"" of sea ice cover in the Beaufort Sea to the north of Alaska, and ""pulses of warm air entering the Arctic from eastern Siberia and northernmost Europe"" helped prime the Arctic for the record low.  Regarding the prospects for setting an all-time record sea ice minimum at the end of the summer, Serreze told Mashable, ""We are starting off definitely on a bad footing here."" Every day in May set a daily sea ice record low, the NSIDC reported, with daily sea ice extents tracking about 232,000 square miles below any previous year in the 38-year satellite record. While the satellite record dates back to 1979, other records from submarines, indigenous peoples' knowledge and clues found in glacial ice cores and other sources point to the sea ice cover likely at its smallest and thinnest state in human history. Importantly for what the May record could mean for the summer sea ice minimum coming up in September, the NSIDC found that daily sea ice extents were two to four weeks ahead of the levels seen in 2012, when the existing September sea ice minimum was recorded.  The Arctic was missing a chunk of sea ice that was twice the size of the state of Texas. Comparing May 2016 with May 2012 shows a stark difference, with last month averaging more than 386,000 square miles below the extent observed in May 2012.  That doesn't necessarily mean that the 2016 sea ice minimum will set a new record, Serreze says, though it does increase the odds of such an outcome. According to Serreze, a rule of thumb in sea ice forecasting holds that the earlier the sea ice melt season starts, the lower the summer sea ice minimum is likely to be. This is because as the reflective, brightly colored sea ice gives way to dark open ocean water, the ocean absorbs more incoming heat, and causes the water to warm up.  Sea ice in May 2016 (bottom right) compared to other previous Mays dating back 38 years. Image: NSIDC This in turn raises overlying air temperatures, helping to melt more ice and continuing the feedback loop known to scientists as Arctic amplification. This is part of the reason why the Arctic is, on average, warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Right now, sea ice cover is unusually small and thin, which means it's more susceptible to melting under the right weather conditions. However, the rule of thumb does not always hold true or prove to be exact, since summer weather patterns will play a big role in moving the ice cover around -- either encouraging some of it to remain intact or instigating a more rapid melt if sunny, mild weather prevails.  The NSIDC reported on Tuesday that sea ice extent remains below average in the Kara and Barents seas, which continues a pattern seen last winter through this spring.  Fragmented ice in the Beaufort Sea in May 2016. Image: NASA/Modis via nsidc Sea ice is also below average in the Bering Sea and East Greenland Sea. And in the Beaufort Sea to the north of Alaska ""large open water areas have formed near the coast and ice to the north is strongly fragmented due to wind-driven divergence,"" the NSIDC said in a statement.  ""The opening began in February, continued through March, and greatly expanded in April,"" the NSIDC said. Air temperatures near the surface during May were 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average across most of the Arctic Ocean, with even higher temperatures, at up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit milder than average, affected sea ice across the Chukchi Sea, which lies to the northwest of Alaska.  Serreze says research is underway to determine what led to the record warmth throughout the winter, and he suspects part of the answer lies in the strong El Nino event in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which released vast quantities of stored ocean heat into the atmosphere. The other major factors, of course, were human-caused global warming, with a dose of natural climate variability added in for good measure. Computer model forecast of temperature anomalies in the Arctic on June 10, 2016, showing continued above average conditions. Image: Weatherbell analytics One of the main areas to watch throughout the rest of the melt season is the Beaufort Sea, where a large area of fragmented sea ice exists, extending all the way to the North Pole. This has led to larger, thicker multiyear ice floes surrounded by thinner first-year ice and open water.  The early emergence of open water areas there may mean that, as in 2007, more of the thick, multiyear ice will perish this summer, which continues a long-term trend.  Due to a malfunctioning satellite sensor, some of the NSIDC's exact figures may change, but the overall record will not be affected since sea ice was so far below average.

""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard have filed a $20 million copyright infringement lawsuit against the British singer-songwriter, whose 2014 hit they claim is largely a ""note-for-note copying"" of ""Amazing,"" a song they wrote in 2009 and recorded by X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012.  They have have hired attorney Richard Busch, who successfully represented Marvin Gaye's family in the now-infamous ""Blurred Lines"" trial, which found Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams guilty of copying Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up.""  In their lawsuit filed Wednesday in a Los Angeles district court, Harrington and Leonard's lawyers argue that ""Photograph"" -- which has sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide and was featured in the film ""Me Before You"" -- is ""extrinsically and intrinsically strikingly similar"" to ""Amazing.""  They point specifically to the chorus sections, which they say share 39 identical notes, matching in ""pitch, rhythmic duration and placement in the measure."" ""In other words,"" they wrote, ""out of the 61 notes in the chorus section of 'Photograph,' approximately 70 percent of the notes are identical to or substantially related to notes in the chorus section of 'Amazing.' Further, 64 percent of the notes in the chorus section of 'Photograph' are identical to the notes in the chorus section of 'Amazing.'"" They continued: ""The sheer magnitude, and verbatim copying of 'Amazing'... is so blatant in both scale and degree, that it raises this matter to an unusual level of striking similarity where access is presumed."" Leonard and Harrington are seeking damages, which they claim exceed $20 million.  A representative for Sheeran has not responded to Mashable's request for comment.  The news comes shortly after Justin Bieber and Skrillex were hit with a similar lawsuit for ""Sorry."" In that lawsuit, singer-songwriter White Hinterland claimed that their chart-topping hit sampled her 2014 song ""Ring the Bell"" without permission. One day later, Skrillex refuted the claims on Twitter, suggesting that the vocal hook in question was actually his own creation, a result of manipulating the original vocals.

The subscription streaming service's first slate of originals launched in February. LOS ANGELES -- Matthew Patrick knows a thing or two about patience. When he first started his YouTube channel in 2010, the 29-year-old -- known to fans as MatPat -- made a video where he analyzed the ""Barrel Roll"" move in the video game Star Fox.   The video, which has amassed more than 2 million views, spawned an idea to do a series on the true science behind video games. Unfortunately, doing such a show requires a big budget, which Patrick did not have. He got to apply the concept to a branded content video for Rainbow Six Siege. But that wasn't enough to satisfy the dream of a series. Then, YouTube Red came along in 2015 -- and MatPat's Game Lab finally became a reality. The series, which debuted on the platform Wednesday, follows Patrick as he explores the real-life science behind popular video games by throwing gamers into the high-stakes scenarios they play through every day, involving everything from water jetpacks to haunted pizzerias. ""We were immediately knocking down the door to have YouTube listen to us,"" he told Mashable. ""I like to say that YouTube was probably so sick of us bothering them about doing this show that they eventually had to make it happen just to get us off their back."" SEE ALSO: 'American Idol' meets 'The Office' in new Fine Bros show on YouTube Red Patrick's channel, The Game Theorists, is known for myth-busting the accuracy of popular video games. He is hoping his 6 million plus subscribers will gravitate toward GameLab, too.  It helps that he recruited 20 of YouTube's biggest gamers to guest star, including CaptainSparklez, the teams behind Smosh Games and GameGrumps, Jake Roper from VSauce3 and Rob Dyke.   The first episode follows the group of gamers competing for style points as they emulate high-intensity parkour elements found in Mirorr's Edge, using the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall as a backdrop. Brian ""Flying Fish"" Fisher from The Warp Zone, and Mari ""Atomic Mari"" Takahashi and Amra ""Flitz"" Ricketts from Smosh Games guest appear. Episode two features Patrick facing off against CaptainSparklez in a game of car soccer after learning the basics of precision driving, inspired by the video game Rocket League. Picking what games to delve into was also a meticulous process of its own. ""There were two main considerations, the first was showcasing a good range of different types of games,"" Patrick said. ""Everything from indie games that are really big on YouTube that the general populace isn't aware of ... to big new releases."" It was also about including a range of experiences. ""I didn't want people coming to series each episode feeling the same."" ""I didn't want people coming to series each episode feeling the same,"" Patrick said. ""You have more suspenseful action filled episodes where we are stealthing into a military base to other ones that are a little more thoughtful like we did an episode all about hacking."" Image: youtube red Making the show wasn't easy. ""Even with the budget that YouTube provided -- which was tremendous -- production is expensive and costly,"" Patrick said. ""Especially when you're going on location."" To stay on budget, Patrick said they had to film all eight episodes in four weeks, which meant each episode had to be done in about two days.   Plus, each episode featured in the series will also be accompanied by a 360-degree virtual reality companion bonus episode, produced by VR production company Specular Theory. ""I wanted there to be a way for the audience to see what I just saw,"" Patrick said. ""While watching me do it or hear me talking about it is one thing, it's so different to actually see those angles and perspectives and be immersed in those worlds. Creating innovative content was a big part of the show for me as well."" The biggest hurdle was trying to make sure the 360-degree element was immersive without showing all the behind-the-scenes production elements. Have something to add to this story?

The Australian accent is really difficult to master. It's the reason why so many actors and voiceover artists mess it up, either sounding like a New Zealander fresh from Dunedin or an odd cockney when it's done all wrong.  SEE ALSO: Ellen DeGeneres pleads with Australians to help save the Great Barrier Reef These are some of the worst takes on accents from Down Under we've ever had the displeasure of hearing. Some of these are dead serious. Some of these are meant to be funny. Either way, they're all not very good. We're sorry.  The awful voiceover on this Property Rights Alliance advertisement  Australia's plain cigarette packaging laws have been very annoying for international tobacco companies, which is why a U.S. lobby group called the Property Rights Alliance released a cringeworthy ad attacking the laws. The group is a so-called ""advocate for physical and intellectual property rights around the globe.""  The first line, ""in life, not everything you hear is true,"" ends up sounding more like, ""een loife, noit everaything is ohlways troh."" It is very clear an American is trying to pull off a terribly earnest take on an Australian accent, which is why so many people are laughing at it. Miley Cyrus as an Australian reporter on Jimmy Kimmel Miley Cyrus struggles to keep up the Australian twang as she fades back and forth to her original American accent as a reporter in a segment for Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August 2015.  It's best exemplified when Cyrus butchers the word ""daughter,"" which sounds something like ""dahhtarr."" The Bold and the Beautiful's Ronn Moss playing an Aussie bushman in a juice commercial OK, so this is a pretty hilarious and clever ad featuring The Bold and the Beautiful's Ronn Moss. The soap star plays a classic Australian bushman, putting on an intentionally terrible accent to prove that juice consumers can tell when something ""isn't all Aussie.""  Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate With a less than delicious 37 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the already forgotten 2013 film The Fifth Estate features English actor Benedict Cumberbatch trying a clumsy Australian drawl as he plays WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. ""When you hear a Brit trying to do an Australian accent, and your accent, I can't tell you how grating it is,"" the real Assange said in an interview with SBS TV show The Feed. Ouch. Daniel Radcliffe in 2007 film December Boys Like a car's engine struggling to keep up as it climbs a hill, Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe can't seem to keep up the Australian accent in 2007's December Boys. It was his first film since the Potter franchise finished up, so we'll forgive him if the very English surrounds of Hogwarts left too much of an impression on him. The 'Australians' Chuck and Hercules Hansen in Pacific Rim The Aussies in 2013's Pacific Rim weren't actually acted by Australians. Chuck is played by British actor Robert Kazinsky, who sounds like he's from north London, while Hercules is played by American Max Martini, still sounding like he is from the States.  Long story short, both accents are utterly, utterly awful. Quentin Tarantino's cameo appearance in Django Unchained We get Quentin Tarantino isn't really an actor, but the mostly excellent 2012 film Django Unchained is let down by a bizarre scene involving Australians -- with Tarantino putting on the most atrocious Aussie accent we've ever heard. Luckily, he was blown up before audiences had to endure more. The accents in that Australian episode of The Simpsons Australians actually really love this particular episode of The Simpsons, which is mostly a send up of the country and its odd traditions (such as booting criminals). Amid the lambasting of sacred cultural icons such as Vegemite, Fosters and Crocodile Dundee, the terrible Australian accents are the icing on the cake. Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian journalist in Natural Born Killers Robert Downey as strong-willed Australian journalist Wayne Gale in Natural Born Killers is a textbook example of why international stars mess up the Down Under accent so easily. It's an exceptionally exaggerated, stressed accent as opposed to the usually relaxed tones of a real Australian.  In bad news for everyone, Downey Jr. also puts on the accent again in 2008 comedy film Tropic Thunder. Nice try Brits and Americans, but you'll have to spend a little more time with your voice coach.

In fact, this is what British warships could look like in as little as 35 years. With RAF jets already being replaced by drones piloted by men sitting at computer screens many miles away, the Royal Navy is now investigating how technology will change the fleet. The answer, it seems, could be a generation of largely remote-controlled seafaring beasts with 'speed of light weapons' and a hull that can make them invisible to the naked eye. The Dreadnought 2050 seen here is a concept ship that could be controlled by only five sailors sitting at screens, much like games consoles. And the entire ship's company could be as little as 50, which compares to the 200 needed for current vessels of this size. Concept images of the ship have been released by a group of leading British electronic systems companies working with naval defence experts Startpoint. The design includes a new-style operations room allowing commanders to focus on specific locations and threats thousands of miles away, from the deep ocean to deep space, using 3D holographics. The ship is fitted with speed of light weapons, while the ultra-strong acrylic hull, coated in a form of carbon called graphene, could be made see-through. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3216304/HMS-Hi-tech-Plans-future-fleet-reveal-Royal-Navy-soon-using-remote-controlled-warships-hulls.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWynZCmePL0/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aWynZCmePL0"	"57593be0d48d081df010890c"	"Daredevil skateboarder takes on Edinburgh Castle's sky high walls"	"Mashape"	"Skateboarders are always looking for the next thrill, and few places offer a challenge quite like Edinburgh Castle.

His tools? Used plastic bottles. SEE ALSO: The 11 most impressive social good innovations from May Ashis Paul's eco-cooler is a zero-electricity air conditioner that uses repurposed plastic bottles to draw cool air into tin huts, in the absence of electricity. It became a low-cost and environment-friendly solution for Bangladesh's poor citizens, a majority of whom live in corrugated tin huts, which can get unbearably hot during summer, when temperatures rise up to 45 degree Celsius. The cooler is designed by cutting plastic bottles in half, and then placing them in a grid on a board. This is then placed on the wall like a window frame. It works on the principle that the bottle's neck can compress the hot breeze and cool it down, dropping temperatures inside the house by as much as five degrees. The project is a collaborative effort between Bangladesh's Grey Group and Grameen intel Social Business Ltd., whose volunteers teach residents how to make the eco-coolers with discarded plastic bottles. They have also put up an instruction manual on their website. So far, the coolers have been installed in over 25,000 homes across the country.  Have something to add to this story?

Instead, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment is delivering a massive pile of add-on stories, levels, characters and features, all based on 16 different popular franchises. It all starts on Sept. 27 with a story pack for the new Ghostbusters, level packs based on Mission: Impossible and Adventure Time, team packs featuring Harry Potter and Adventure Time characters, and a fun pack based on The A-Team. SEE ALSO: Disney is done with game publishing, cancels 'Disney Infinity' After the initial release, you can expect to see an assortment of other packs released, based on November's new Harry Potter-verse movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them; The Lego Batman Movie; The Goonies; Sonic the Hedgehog; Teen Titans Go!; Lego City Undercover; Knight Rider; Powerpuff Girls; Beetlejuice; Gremlins; and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Much like the first year of Dimensions releases, all of the packs released after Sept. 27 will arrive in waves, carrying through into the summer of 2017. While all of the add-on packs do include physical Lego creations, using them in tandem with the video game does require the Lego Dimensions Starter Pack that was released in 2015. Since there's no new Starter Pack or Toy Pad (the USB device that pairs physical Lego bricks with the game), last year's model is compatible with everything, new and old. Also coming with the new add-on packs are Battle Arenas, a competitive game mode for up to four players in splitscreen mode (no online play). Lego minifigures released on and after Sept. 27 all include special golden Toy Tags that unlock the franchise's associated Arena.  If you're looking for larger add-ons, the Ghostbusters (based on the July 15 movie) and Fantastic Beasts packs are it. They'll feature new gateway bricks for the Toy Pad and a larger selection of story levels. Lego Dimensions faces significantly less competition in 2016 with the end of Disney Infinity's run. Both, along with Activision's Skylanders, fall into the ""toys to life"" genre, which melds video games with physical toys in the real world. Have something to add to this story?

This coveted, ridiculously overpowered heavy weapon was a favorite among ""Year One"" players, but it fell into the mists of history when The Taken King rendered it obsolete. Now we know it's coming back, thanks to a leaked trailer for Destiny expansion Rise of Iron, which arrives on Sept. 20.

The trailer reveals the basics of what we can expect to see from Rise of Iron: story missions, a new lineup of gear, new exploration and social zones, an additional mode for Crucible (PvP mode), a Strike, a raid and a new faction of Fallen mutants. Some of these details slipped out on Wednesday in a prematurely posted Xbox Store page, but the trailer lets you see it for yourself. As for Gjallarhorn, the Year One rocket launcher is getting refurbished for Rise of Iron, presumably with a bit less stopping power than it used to have. And in an unexpected twist, this ""Iron Gjallarhorn"" will be obtainable as a freebie pre-order bonus.

A charity has launched a campaign (#respectthewater) to raise awareness of the dangers of water after it was revealed that the number of people killed off the UK coastline reached a record number last year.  The RNLI said some 168 people died in 2015, the highest number in five years, while 385 others were rescued in near-fatal incidents. Over half (52%) of the dead were people taking part in activities such as coastal walking, running, climbing or angling. SEE ALSO: Students make a giant chessboard from refugees' life jackets on Greek island RNLI coastal safety manager James Millidge said the figures suggest people are ""not taking enough care"" along the coastline. The campaign features a POV video of a man in the water near the coastline. An off camera voice says ""So, how long can you hold your breath?""  The man dives in cold water for a few seconds but starts panicking and frantically tries to swim. After a few failed attempts, the man fails to breathe and dies. ""On land, you would've have survived this as the average person can hold their breath for 45 seconds, in the water you might not last 10. Even on a warm day, cold water shock can leave you helpless,"" says the voice.  On the campaign's website, users can also take up an interactive challenge to check whether they know what to do if you fall into the water.  Image: RNLI ""People often don't realise how cold our seas can be. Even in summer months the sea temperature rarely exceeds 12C (54F), which is low enough to trigger cold water shock,"" Millidge said. ""If you enter the water suddenly at that temperature, you'll start gasping uncontrollably, which can draw water into your lungs and cause drowning. The coldness also numbs you, leaving you helpless, unable to swim or shout for help."" ""If you're planning to get into the water be aware that, even if it looks calm on the surface, there can be strong rip currents beneath the surface, which can quickly drag you out to sea.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself.

The flickering of lights above. The sounds of everyday life which many people simply don't notice can be overwhelming for someone who is on the autism spectrum. SEE ALSO: Video brings you the sensory overload a boy with autism feels Now everyone can feel what this is like with the National Autistic Society's virtual reality experience. It's a remake of their video about a boy with autism who becomes overwhelmed in a shopping centre with his mother. In the VR experience, you are seeing the situation through the boy's eyes. Autism is ""a developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people and how they experience the world around them,"" the society says. In the 360-degree video, you can look around and see and hear the different sensations. For the VR experience, you can download the app here and view the film with Google Cardboard. The charity hopes that the medium of VR will effectively communicate the experiences of someone with autism, and that the public will respond with empathy. ""To help the public understand a little more about autism, we're really excited to be the first charity using virtual reality to demonstrate what this aspect of autism can feel, see and sound like,"" said Mark Lever, chief executive of the charity, in a release sent to Mashable. ""You can just show someone inside your head!"" Alex Marshall, the 10-year-old boy, was thrilled to star in the film. ""I've loved being part of the National Autistic Society's film, it was like winning the lottery twenty gazillion times and I'm really excited about the VR so I can show my friends how things feel for me. ""It really helps when people understand things, and this is a really cool way to do it - you can just show someone inside your head!"" he said. As part of its Too Much Information campaign, the charity will be showing the VR experience at sites around the UK, and providing a schools pack with a lesson plan about autism.

That reconciliation came after a competitive, at many times bitter, primary fight for the Democratic nomination in 2008.

Lenovo unveiled the Phab2 Pro, the first flagship Project Tango smartphone, on Thursday at the company's Tech World event in San Francisco. The unveiling comes more than two years after Google first introduced Project Tango, its (at the time) experimental effort to bring computer vision and 3D-sensing abilities to smartphones and tablets. SEE ALSO: Google Daydream and Project Tango: We've gotta get these guys together In addition to the typical cameras and sensors that power most smartphones, Tango devices are equipped with motion and depth sensors, along with computer vision software, to create augmented-reality experiences that wouldn't be otherwise be possible on a smartphone. The Phab2 Pro is massive, weighing more than half a pound. These extra components (and the types of experiences they create) help account for the Phab2 Pro's massive size -- and it is massive. Its Quad HD display clocks in at a plus-size 6.4 inches, and it weighs more than half a pound. ""It was a tough engineering feat,"" Lenovo's VP of Android Jeff Meredith tells Mashable.""You need a relatively large screen to be able to fully take advantage and enjoy the experience of what Tango offers... we felt that 6.4 was the right selection for us at this stage."" Display aside, the handset is also equipped with a 4K-ready 16MP camera, 4GB of RAM and dual SIM slots all powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor. It comes in two color variants: champagne gold and gunmetal gray and comes with 64GB of storage, along with a microSD slot. Lenovo's Phab2 Pro. Image: Lenovo Those would be more than respectable specs by most Android flagship standards but more impressive may be the price: The Phab2 Pro will cost just $499 when it goes on sale in August. For those who want to spend a little less, Lenovo is also introducing two other Tango-enabled handsets, the $199 Phab2 and $299 Phab2 Plus.  The $199 Phab2 also has a 6.4-inch HD display and is equipped with a 13MP camera. The $299 Phab2 Plus, on the other hand, is being positioned as a midrange device that doesn't skimp on the camera. The device, also 6.4-inches, has two 13MP rear-facing cameras with f/2.0 lenses. The cameras are powered by the same image processor inside of a Leica camera, Lenovo says. Of course, extra cameras, 3D-sensing, and advanced computer vision are only as good as the apps that can actually take advantage of them. There are already more than 100 Tango-ready apps in Google Play, including several augmented reality games. Gaming, says Meredith, will likely be one of the biggest use cases for Project Tango since it marks the first time gamers can get a true augmented-reality experience on a smartphone. But AR is good for more than just games: Lenovo also showed off an app from Google called Measure, which allows people to measure the dimensions of the spaces around them just by pointing the device at the area. Lowe's, one of the first retailers that will sell the Phab2 Pro, also has an app that allows users to see visualizations of how new appliances and other items will look in their houses before they buy them. The Phab2Pro will go on sale in August for $399, the $299 Phab2 Plus and $199 Phab2 will both be available in September.  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

The progressive online news program, which has amassed 2.4 million subscribers since it started live streaming on YouTube in 2005, brought Woodley on to talk about why she feels the Bern. The program itself -- which has twice had Sanders on as a guest -- is openly pro-Sanders, as well. Woodley, 24, said she was not politically active until Sanders came to her attention in February.  ""What he [Bernie Sanders] stands for resonated for me,"" she told host Cenk Uygur. ""He really wants to improve the human condition, especially for those who have been marginalized for so many years. And his integrity, his truth, his honesty... he's been on the right side of history. Everything that he stands for, I support.""

Martin Jetpack Jetpacks are the personal vehicle of choice for the future, at least according to The Jetsons. You can get ahead of the crowd and preorder the Martin Jetpack, which will cost around $125,000, The Guardian reports. Martin Jetpacks aren't like the water-propelled jetpacks you see today with tubes that extend down into water. The Martin will run on gasoline/aircraft fuel, which powers two large fans. Its engines push out 210 horse power and it can hold up to about 260 pounds. You don't need to be a master pilot to fly your Martin Jetpack because it has self-balancing technology, and if you're in trouble, you can deploy a parachute. The personal Martin Jetpack will be released in 2017, while first responders will be able to get them in the second half of 2016. Numi smart toilet For most people, a toilet with a decent seat and flusher is just about all that's necessary for their bathroom experience. But there's a good chance they haven't tried the luxurious Kohler's intelligent Numi toilet and its abundance of features. Not only does the $4,750 toilet open and close automatically, it has a heated seat, foot warmers, a customizable bidet, an air dryer, a deodorizer and speakers to play your favorite music.

The Personal Submarine Just because you want to see the bottom of the ocean doesn't mean your have to get wet doing it. The Personal Submarine is the vehicle for a rich person who already has cars, boats and planes. And it only costs $2 million. Image: Hammacher Schlemmer The Personal Submarine has a transparent sphere that fits two people and can explore depths up to 1,000 feet. Don't expect to stay submerged all day though; its battery only lasts for six hours. The design makes it stable on the surface too, so when your battery starts to run low, you can just hang out and eat caviar while you wait for a tugboat. This submarine is fully certified as a passenger-carrying manned submarine, and the price includes comprehensive training (i.e. don't worry if you don't have your submarine-driver's license yet).

Aerigon UAV drone that shoots 4K video There are a lot of drones on the market, and a whole bunch of them shoot video. But these little flying cameras don't usually give you the best quality video, especially not good enough to shoot a car commercial with. Enter the Aerigon UAV drone with a Phantom Flex 4K camera attached to it, which is a roughly $250,000 creation. The Aerigon UAV is a pretty heavy-duty drone that uses six propellers to lift up to 19 pounds, which means it has the strength to hold up a heavy-hitting camera like the Phantom Flex 4K without breaking a sweat. If you just want to fly the drone by itself, you'll still have to shell out about $50,000.

Samsung Family Hub smart fridge What separates a $5,000 refrigerator from a $900 one? Brains. Samsung's smart fridge, the Family Hub, turns your standard kitchen appliance into something more akin to an entertainment center. It even tells you when to buy more eggs. The fridge has a large touchscreen on its door that shows you what's inside, lets you place online grocery orders and gives you weather updates. Image: Samsung The Family Hub can also display a calendar, notes for your fellow habitants, photos, or even play your favorite music or movies. Yep, this fridge plays movies. Image: Samsung It also keeps your food cold, if you're into that sort of thing. VPI Classic Direct Turntable People can be pretty picky about their turntables, especially when they have the money to throw at a really good one. But ""really good"" doesn't even describe VPI's Classic line of turntables, which can run up to $30,000 for some models. The VPI Classic Direct Turntable Image: VPI These turntables are made with some of the best audio parts money can buy. With massive plinths made of steel and aluminum, the record players weigh around 65 pounds while eliminating almost all audio resonance.  The VPI Classic Signature Turntable Image: vpi Noble Audio Prestige earbuds While there are some high-quality and expensive over-ear headphones available, some people just want great earbuds. Noble Audio has a pretty awesome selection of Prestige earbuds, which can cost up to $2,900.  Image: noble audio A good chunk of that price comes from the materials used to make the eye-catching designs such as carbon glass, Siamese Rosewood and other custom materials. In addition, Noble Audio doesn't skimp on the technical side. The headphones are named Kaiser 10 because they use 10 drivers in each bud to produce super-clear, deep sounds. Normal headphones have one driver in each earpiece.  Gray International phone case Even if you're super rich, you're probably going to have the same smartphone as everyone else. To show off a little wealth, you can opt for a pricy Gray International case designed for iPhone 6 and 6S. The cases start at $500, but the top-of-the-line protector will run you $1000. The Advent case (above) is only a bumper, which means it only covers the sides of the phone, but it's designed with grade 5 titanium found in spaceships and Formula 1 cars, so you can rest easy when you drop it on the pavement. Christie Roadie projector Regular movie fans may be satisfied with a 50-inch TV and a Blu Ray copy of a movie, but that may not cut it for super fans. If you fall into this category and have $140,000 to spend, check out the Christie Roadie 4K45 4K DLP Projector.  Image: christie/b&h This projector natively plays video in 4K at 60 frames per second, emitting 45,000 lumens to deliver a premium movie viewing experience. Of course, you can't have a projector like this without a big screen to capture the image, so you might want to check out the $1,300 Da-Lite 87164V Cinema Contour Deluxe Screen, which measures 119 inches diagonally (and is relatively cheap compared to the rest of this list).

"Mashape"	"Even as President Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton Thursday, he took the time to thank Bernie Sanders for raising important issues of inequality, and for bringing young people back into the political process.  He was right to do so. If it stays connected and engaged the way it has been on social media so far, Bernie's 11.5 million-strong army could do to the Dems what the Tea Party did to the Republicans -- dominate their local politics, win their primaries, win state houses and effectively capture Congress. By playing the long electoral game, we could actually see a day where single-payer healthcare passes both houses, thanks to Bernie.  SEE ALSO: President Obama officially endorses Hillary Clinton for president On the other hand, some Sanders supporters are already talking about going against the wishes of their candidate, who said Thursday he wanted to work with Clinton to defeat Trump. They could yet help to put a race-baiting, climate change-denying, abortion rights-ending scofflaw demagogue in the White House -- and hand him the political swing seat in the Supreme Court to boot. If you don't think that's a possibility -- if you are absolutely certain that Team Sanders is too smart to harrumph off to the polls in November and vote for Trump out of denial or spite -- I dare you to head over to the ""Sanders for President"" subreddit.   Here you'll find the kind of comments that seem designed to keep sane people up at night. Especially on a popular thread that points to the size of the Bernie voting bloc, and how few of them Trump would need to win -- 15%, the original poster claims based on primary math.  General election math is different, of course, with many more people turning out. But that's not the point. Some polls have suggested 33% of Bernie supporters won't vote for Clinton. And in any case, this topic is merely a magnet for Bernie supporters who are hurting and willing to lash out -- a minority blinded by Clinton hatred enough to become Trump supporters. SEE ALSO: Hey America, you may be sleepwalking into a Donald Trump presidency Could some of them be Trump trolls? Sure, but not all. Were people fighting the pro-Trump commenters? Sporadically and sort-of. Did plenty of others chime in that they'd be voting for libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein? You betcha.   But the threat is real; this, after all, is surely one reason Bernie has long been beating Trump by greater numbers than Hillary in the polls. (Here's another important reason.) When asked about supporting Bernie over Trump, her voters have no hesitation. When the reverse question is asked, enough of Bernie's voters hesitate to depress the margin. Strange bedfellows? New Hampshire back in February, Bernie and Trump supporters mingled outside a polling place. Image: Chip Somodevilla/ Getty Images So for a snapshot of possible things to come, check out the kinds of pro-Trump arguments the thread attracted. They have been anonymized and categorized. Necessary annotations have been added. Original grammar has been preserved. Trump is actually more popular than Hillary, and his popularity is bulletproof!  HRC is dead in the water for the general unless Trump starts wearing a Hitler costume to rallies Nope. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has found Clinton up by 10% against Trump for the past two weeks running, even as the Democratic party remained split almost exactly down the middle about her. Sure, her lead is tighter in other polls of the last month. But since February, nearly every poll has put her ahead. Only Fox News and the notoriously right-leaning Rasmussen polls have occasionally found Trump ahead by a point or two; even they have found Hillary ahead by as much as 11% in that timeframe, too.  A candidate doesn't need to dress like Hitler for people to find his speech abhorrent. Trump is self-funded and thus truly independent! [Trump] would be our first president not funded by the same establishment that has funded all our presidents (and Hillary) for the past few decades. And THAT is far more historic than having an evil woman saying she is the first female president. I'm going to vote Trump troll on this one, but let's tackle it regardless. No, Trump is not self-funded, and hasn't been for a long time. He's happy to take the GOP's money, both in hard cash and in unlimited soft money ads, for the general election.  But sure, if you define ""independence"" as Trump saying whatever egomaniacal hater nonsense spills out of his head, be it outrageous or merely illegal, he's pretty ""independent."" By that measure, so was Idi Amin.  Trump fights for the working class, like Bernie! He's probably a secret progressive! Bernie was the first Democrat I ever got behind. On my main issues, excluding healthcare, him and Trump are the same. His foreign policy is basically Bernie's. So is his trade policy. He is okay with gays and transgenders. Trump is a progressive on social issues and not a warmonger... All my energy and passion is now going to Trump. He's against the TPP. He's against NAFTA. He kicked the warmongers and globalists out of the GOP. Trump has better policies on corruption and trade deals than Clinton and those are my top national voting issues. Where to start here? Let's dismiss immediately the notion that Trump is ""okay with the gays"" or at all progressive on social issues. He's against gay marriage, even now it is the law of the land. He would seek to reverse that with his Supreme Court picks, as teed up for him by the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump says his justice(s) would try to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Anyone who says ""Bernie and Trump are the same excluding healthcare"" should turn their Bernie supporter card in Anyone who says ""Bernie and Trump are the same excluding healthcare,"" or compares their foreign policy favorably, should turn their Bernie supporter card in. Has Bernie suggested arming Japan and South Korea with nuclear weapons? Does Bernie want to build a multibillion-dollar boondoggle of a wall, or use a new immigration police force to round up 11 million people?  Has Bernie proposed banning 1.5 billion of the world's citizens from entering the United States, based on a religious test? Does Bernie dig torture or war crimes? More importantly than any of this is the belief that Trump actually believes in and cares about anything or anyone that is not gratifyingly pro-Trump.  What is Trump's trade policy, really? We don't know, because all he has spouted is abject nonsense about ""winning,"" a ridiculous and illegal proposal to add a 45% tariff to all Chinese goods, and the occasional crowd-pleasing diatribe about trade deals.   But you go ahead and project all your progressive hopes on Trump based on something he said on a particular day, before he replaced it with something new the next day. He is happy to let you do that. That's the reason fascist politicians have incoherent and broad economic policies; it allows anyone to imagine they actually share the same beliefs, under the surface.  It'll hurt Hillary! Honestly, gotta consider trump. its a double hit vs hillary. a denied vote to her, and one given to her opposition. My only vote is going to Trump. Poke them in the eye. The establishment has made us so mad that we may not favor them with any votes. Her campaign and their blatant circumventing of the rules are the biggest affront to democracy I've witnessed in my lifetime. If it takes a trump presidency to show them they can't do this shit anymore than so be it. A phrase about cutting, your nose, your face and spite comes to mind. Or if you'd rather talk about poking and eyes, imagine yourself trying to go all Mountain-vs.-Red Viper on the ""Establishment"", only to realize you've actually crushed the life out of the Paris Accords, the world's last best hope on climate change, and accidentally annihilated the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. Whoops! SEE ALSO: Trump on climate: He's even worse than we thought And if you still believe that the Clinton campaign ""circumvented the rules"", rather than played by the rules of a primary and caucus game that was convoluted, unhelpful and byzantine to outsiders in the first place, I'm prescribing you a repeat dose of this John Oliver video. Watch it twice and call me in the morning. He won't really be powerful anyway! But magically, Hillary will! I always feel like Trump's insane and dangerous ideas don't have a snowball's chance in hell of passing through Congress. Hillary Clinton's insane and dangerous ideas (more wars, fracking, ""free trade"" agreements, etc.), on the other hand, do.  We will get 4 years of nothing done, but it will be 4 years of the Republicans back peddling from Trump's message. Clinton is far more likely to get us into war. She'll get Democrats and Congress to go a long with her war and she's already promising one. If Trump tries to start something we may finally see Congress assert their power by cutting off funding or voting against military action. Besides, war is bad for business. He's probably all talk. Again, Trump doesn't have much of an agenda to pass through Congress. Just as the Supreme Court will be picked by the Heritage Foundation, policy-making will almost certainly be ceded to the Tea Party in the House. Trump will be happy to focus on the glamor of being president, and to sign whatever piece-of-red-meat law will keep his base happy and make sure they vote for him next time around.  As for ""promising war,"" there's only one candidate who is beating the drums with talk that destabilizes just about every international relationship America has. One candidate who wants to ""bomb the hell out of ISIS,"" a logistical impossibility given the civilian situation, and has talked of sending 30,000 troops into Iraq and Syria. His name isn't Hillary Clinton. In the abstract, going to war with someone, anyone, most definitely benefits a President Trump. He not only gets to look stern and Churchillian, his best look, he also gets to dismiss all criticism of him being a lightweight as unpatriotic. You all remember how much America desperately needed to believe George W. Bush was a good wartime president?  Image: AP PHOTO/ Paul Sancya We'll get a Bernie-like president faster! I hope Trump wins and we have another go around for a real prog[ressive] in 4 years. A Trump victory will have consequences for the Democratic party insiders who put their thumbs on the scales and sandbagged Bernie. maybe US needs Trump to wake the hell up and in 4 years there is a solid chance we get to have a progressive candidate winning after all Right! Because we all remember how well that worked out in 2004, when a lightweight president had led us into not one but two wars and instituted a torture regime that he could plausibly deny. He was swept out of power rather than reelected, right?  He totally didn't use his office to promote wedge issues against minorities his base could hate, helping to boost turnout (then: The gays! Next up: The Mexicans!) and eking out a 50.1% general election victory. No sir.  But seriously, how bad was Hitler anyway?  Just making Hitler president wouldn't replay 1930s-40s germany in the US. I do honestly think that a Hillary presidency would turn out worse. I have finally reached the point where the GOP could run Hitler himself and I still wouldn't be moved to cast for the DNC. Why don't you like trump, you realize every country in the world deports illegal aliens, even mexico. His speech might be crass and offend some of the liberal elite but is he wrong? Why? what you get from hillary will be the enslavement of men to women. no thanks I'll pass I can't even. And I don't know any Bernie supporters -- as a rule, very intelligent and historically aware people -- who could even with this. He's the lesser of two evils! If Hillary's ""Track record"" is anything to go off of then give me Trump. I know I'm voting Trump if Bernie gives up. Lesser of two evils and all. He honestly seems like the lesser of two evils. I feel like all his crazy things he says will never get passed anyways. I'm betting a lot more than 15% will be MORE than happy to swing the election to Trumps favor I'm really leaning towards Trump at this moment. Honestly, at this point I am not seeing any downside of a Trump Presidency. Fuck all of you who voted for the establishment. The original recipe was Bush vs Clinton for this year, and at least the Republicans saw through it and change the script. The establishment will pay. Fuck this bullshit. Fuck this bullshit indeed.  If you think being pro-choice is more evil than being pro-life, if you think trying to save the planet with carbon-reduction agreements is more evil than letting it burn, if you think gay marriage is more evil than being unequal, if you think the rule of law is more evil than having contempt for judges, if you think one Secretary of State seeing sensitive state documents in her private email is somehow more evil than Colin Powell doing the exact same thing, then guess what. You have nothing at all in common with Bernie Sanders.  Will 15% or even 33% of Bernie's supporters cross the aisle and vote for Trump regardless? We won't know for months.  But based on the evidence of some who say they're keen to do so, it isn't for any reasons this transformative, revolutionary candidate would endorse."

From SpaceX's particular brand of rocketry to Tesla Motors' disruption of the car industry, Carter and the sprawling department he heads have a lot to learn from Musk's agile way of working within and outside of an industry. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk drops more hints that he is, in fact, Iron Man However, the exact topic of the meeting have not been revealed, leading to much speculation as to what, specifically, they talked about. Is Musk -- as he joked -- actually building an Iron Man suit? Does the Defense Department want to award them more launch contracts? Are Secretary Carter and Musk both just really big fans of video games? According to comments by Pentagon Press Secretary John Cook ahead of the meeting, Carter and Musk met at the Pentagon to chat about ""innovation."" Something about a flying metal suit...https://t.co/6Z1D9iZ1fV -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2016 ""Obviously, Elon Musk is one of the most innovative minds in this country,"" Cook said, according to a transcript. Of course, ""innovation"" isn't exactly the most specific conversation starter, but Carter is known for his efforts to build bridges between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley. Carter is a fan of Silicon Valley Carter is the first Secretary of Defense to even visit Silicon Valley in about 20 years, and this meeting with Musk comes after he met with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, among other tech industry leaders.  Meeting with innovators in Silicon Valley can help the Defense Department ""stay as ahead as we can from a technological standpoint,"" a Defense Department official told Mashable in an interview. Ash Carter speaks with Reid Hoffman co-founder of LinkedIn at the LinkedIn headquarters Image: DOD/Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz Carter explained the agency's Silicon Valley ""outpost"" during a May speech on innovation in Mountain View, California.  ""When I began my career in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense,"" he said.  ""Today, we're still major sponsors, much more technology is commercial, and the technology base is global,"" he said. ""And nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap with us."" ""So, to stay ahead of those challenges and stay the best, I've been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our fix-sided box, and invest aggressively in change and innovation,"" Carter added. Ash Carter meets with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on July 9, 2015. Image: DOD/Glenn Fawcett To that end, under Carter, the Defense Department has established the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), set up to help the country stay ahead of the curve on new technologies. DIUx employs people who came up in Silicon Valley. Isaac Taylor, for example, was the head of operations for Google X before joining the Pentagon outfit. Musk is a poster-boy for innovation and government influence Musk and Carter also have a fair bit to talk about when it comes to SpaceX. Musk's spaceflight company is already in business with the Department of Defense, planning to launch a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office in 2017, according to the space industry publication Space News.  And, while exact figures aren't available, Musk has claimed that SpaceX's rockets are far cheaper to fly than rockets from other more established launch providers like United Launch Alliance -- a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Musk is also a perfect example of profitable relationships between private companies and government entities.  SpaceX has been, in some ways, propped up by its contracts with NASA.  The company won a key contract to fly cargo to the International Space Station for the agency using the spaceflight company's Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket, and now the firm is working toward fulfilling a contract to fly astronauts to the Space Station as soon as next year. Of course, that kind of symbiotic relationship can become contentious, too.  In 2015, SpaceX took the U.S. Air Force to court after United Launch Alliance was awarded a launch contract that Musk's company thought should have been open for competition.  SpaceX eventually settled the suit out of court and won a contract to launch an Air Force GPS satellite in 2018.  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

Pl retweet! https://t.co/mHKsK67TjY -- Nikhil Kamkolkar (@indiancowboy) June 8, 2016 The launch of Amazon Video Direct ignited speculation from media outlets -- including Mashable -- and media analysts that Amazon was going after YouTube.  On Thursday, Re-code even published an article titled ""Amazon vs. YouTube: Why the content creator is the ultimate winner."" But is it a real YouTube alternative? And does it even want to be?  Short answer: No and no. So why now? Ask Vice President of Amazon Video Jim Freeman and he'll tell you the decision to launch Amazon Video Direct was driven by consumer demand. The company saw great success with its Kindle Direct Publishing initiative -- a self publishing book service -- and wanted to see if the same concept could be applied to video. In 2010, the company also launched an Amazon Studios initiative, which gave creators the ability to pitch a screenplay or video concept to Amazon. This strategy drew in talent not unlike the on-the-rise filmmakers pitching to Netflix, HBO and Hulu. ""Our thinking really was that this is a successful model in other areas, it's a great time to be a content creator in the digital video space and we want to be open to talent and great stories everywhere,"" Freeman told Mashable in a recent phone interview. ""So let's create a platform that makes that possible."" Freeman maintains it's not about competing with other major players. In fact, the approach to Amazon Video Direct is fundamentally different than that of YouTube.  ""We don't over-focus on competitors and what they are doing,"" he said. ""Our focus was both the video provider as a customer as well as consumer as customer. We understood there might be comparisons drawn, but we are feeling good about the problem we are addressing for video providers and their enthusiasm."" Amazon Video Direct is seemingly more similar to Vimeo -- which attracts talent with favorable revenue splits and tools that provide the opportunity to set up paywalls. YouTube hasn't been commenting on the new Amazon offering.  A Vimeo spokesperson told Mashable that while ""Amazon is an incredible platform and formidable force...we believe our platform stands apart with some key differentiators and is the platform of choice for creators."" Among those differentiators: It's available across the globe (Amazon is in five key markets). SEE ALSO: The next YouTube? Amazon now allows creators to post content on its platform Despite the crowded ecosystem, some analysts feel Amazon can succeed, especially because it already has such a large built-in customer base. Peter Csathy, chief executive of business advisory firm Manatt Digital Media, said Amazon Video Direct is a move in the right direction for the company. ""It's giving content creators a playground for experimentation,"" he told Mashable. ""When you have that playground to play in, it really depends on what people use it for. People will experiment in it and see what work sand what sticks. It's another new platform that's different."" Pros & Cons Already, Mashable, Conde Nast Entertainment, HowStuffWorks, Samuel Goldwyn Films, the Guardian, Mattel, StyleHaul, Kin Community, Jash, Business Insider, Machinima, TYT Network, Baby Einstein, CJ Entertainment America, Xive TV, Synergetic Distribution, Kino Nation, Journeyman Pictures and Pro Guitar Lessons have partnered up with Amazon to test out the new offering. Image: amazon press release An added incentive for non big-name players looking to self-upload: The ""AVD Stars program."" This gives creators a monthly bonus from a $1 million fund based on the top 100 AVD titles offered in Prime Video. Creators are certainly mulling their options. Immediately following the news, many took to Amazon Video Direct's Facebook page to comment on their frustrations with the upload process, including the multiple download steps and caption and JPG size stipulations. For example, one Facebook user wrote: ""If you hear this service is going to compete with YouTube, don't believe it. The overly complicated account creation vs. YouTube easy account creation will be the Achilles heel of this service."" For others, the pros outweigh the cons.  StyleHaul, a Los Angeles-based fashion and lifestyle digital network, sees Amazon as a way to bring more exposure to its network of 6,500 creators and all their original series. Already the company has struck deals with distribution outlets such as Verizon's go90 platform for shows like Relationship Status.  ""Amazon over the last few year has really made massive strides in establishing itself as a creation and distribution platform for premium content,"" StyleHaul Chief Content Officer Mia Goldwyn told Mashable. ""I think that having the opportunity to bring some of these StyleHaul premium original series to an amazon audience is a massive win."" As for Kamkolkar, he's pretty content with the exposure his film has gotten in such a short amount of time. He said after two weeks of being available online, his feature film was ""sitting at over 15K minutes viewed. Compared to zero for the past half-dozen years."" A scene from ""Indian Cowboy: A Love-Love Story."" Image: Nikhil Kamkolkar ""I hope to experiment with marketing and focus on building an end-to-end pipeline [using Amazon Video Direct],"" he said. ""When I work on a script now, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, even if I know the journey will be a long one."" Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

The inaugural fest will feature The Lab, an interactive art experience that ""invites festivalgoers to challenge all of their senses"" with seven interactive installations and a 360 virtual reality theater. Presented by The Verge and powered by HP INC, the exhibit will feature work from exclusively New York-based artists, curated by META.is. SEE ALSO: Experience Coachella in your own little world... if you want ""The relationship between art, music, and technology is blurring in ways unimaginable in the past,"" HP's Alyson Griffin said in a statement to Mashable. And indeed, some of the installations are hard to imagine.  There's The Art of Pinball -- which reimagines an old game for 2016 through a digital art performance -- and Cotton Candy Theremin, created by Emilie Baltz and Philip Sierzga, which transforms the process of making cotton candy into ""a multi-sensory orchestration."" And yes, the cotton candy is made of real sugar, it just add some ""audio-visual music"" into the mix, says Justin Bolognino, chief experience officer at META.is. ""The Lab at Panorama will allow festival goers to see technology as a tool, allowing us to remember that we are essentially one interconnected organism,"" he said. ""Humans that work with and alongside technology will help us to evolve as a species."" Visceral Recess is an inflatable adult playground that encourages people ""to become more familiar with their intrinsic selves."" Hyper Thread allows festivalgoers to ""explore, manipulate, and create sounds in real time"" via a a series of silk cocoons. And Infiinite Wall sounds like Panorama's own Infinity Mirrored Room, an installation of mirrors, lights and sounds that respond to one's presence via motion sensor.  The Lab  also features The Dome a 70-foot structure that houses the 360-degree immersive theater. It features original music, sound design and audiospecialization by Antfood.  This is hardly the first time music festivals have gotten into the VR game. This year, Coachella gave cardboard VR headsets to each festivalgoer, and invited those who couldn't make it to Indio to join in via its own VR app.  Have something to add to this story?

Netflix has ordered 10 episodes of the half-hour comedy as it continues its push for original programming.

The classic Stanley Kubrick horror flick full of ghosts and madness is not my idea of a good vacation spot, but that hasn't stopped me from stepping inside its world through an immersive video. YouTube user Claire Sophie brings us a bizarre 360-degree look at ""The Shining"" that pans through a distorted vision of the Overlook hotel and its grounds, including the famous maze. More 'Shining' stories Will 'The Shining' still terrify audiences in opera form? 'The Shining' hotel may get even scarier as a horror museum Here's the method for making this unusual visual experiment: ""Using photogrammetry, 3D elements are extracted and extruded from the original film stills, and the subsequent fragments are stitched together and viewed along the original camera path."" The video, which posted Tuesday, jumps straight into surreal territory with the opening credits blending into the landscape, characters appearing like ghosts and jagged black edges making it seem like the end of the world outside of the sets. Claire Sophie's YouTube channel is filled with fascinating immersive explorations, including a dive into Dali's ""Persistence of Memory"" and a strange animated version of Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"" where you stand in Venus's spot above the shell.

The event was broadcast in Japanese, but DualShockers has provided a recap of all the new gameplay information discussed. Among this is confirmation that the game will feature a character progression system that functions similar to a skill tree. The game also isn't fully open-world in the sense that you can go anywhere at any time. Instead it presents locations in sequence, but these are large and can be explored. As the game progresses, the locations players can travel to increase in number and variety. In terms of gameplay, Tabata emphasised that you won't need to be good at action games to be successful in Final Fantasy XV. Despite looking very much like an action game in trailers, it is an RPG at its core. The game will introduce its systems gradually, and there will be difficulty options for those that want to tweak it. In total, protagonist Noctis will have seven weapon types in his Armiger Arsenal. Since the weapons in Armiger are linked to story, Tabata said he couldn't reveal all of these yet. It was also suggested that piloting the airship will be more involved than it has been in the past. Tabata said while taking off is easy, landing is a little trickier. If players crash, they'll have to start over at a checkpoint before the takeoff. Other details that were revealed include confirmation that you'll be able to save anywhere and can fast travel to places previously camped at. Meanwhile, players can give Chocobo speed and stamina boosts by feeding them food. It was also revealed that Noctis's Car, The Regalia, can outpace Chocobos. The Final Fantasy 15 release date is set for September 2016 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A PC version could come later, but nothing specific has been announced. In April, Tabata said that, when he took over as director on the project, one of his first decisions was to conduct an analysis of the current state of the Final Fantasy brand in Japan. He found that the franchise was considered a ""dying IP that had already peaked."" Despite this, fans also showed support for Square Enix and believed that the franchise could be returned to its former glory. ""One thing I've felt from fans is that they are disappointed in the current state of Final Fantasy, but still have hope in terms of where the brand could go,"" he said."

Today, Bethesda updated Fallout 4's Xbox One version to including support for Bethesda.net mods, letting you do all manner of crazy things like make your dog a cat. The Bethesda.net mods hub is now available inside Fallout 4 on Xbox One. You can search for whatever mod you want (the cat one is called CatMeat), see some images and a description, and then download and install it. There is a 2 GB cap, but you can delete mods to free up space whenever you want. The mods, which are free, are made on PC using the Creation Kit. To get a better idea for how Fallout 4 mods work on console, check out the overview video below. As explained during last week's livestream event, when you have Fallout 4 mods installed, due to first-party considerations, you cannot earn any achievements. Additionally, in order to play Fallout 4 mods that make use of the game's DLC (like the recently released Far Harbor expansion), you will need to own that DLC. When you use mods, the game creates a new save. If something goes wrong with the mod and you lose progress (the game crashed at one point during the livestream), you can revert back to your regular, non-mod save game. In other news about Fallout 4 console mods, Bethesda has confirmed that they are still on track to come to PlayStation 4 in June. Fallout 4's console mod program was announced at E3 2015. Bethesda later explained why it partnered with Microsoft to launch them first on Xbox One. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt developer CD Projekt Red has also talked about possibly bringing PC mods to console, but this hasn't happened yet and it's unclear if it ever will. Are you planning to jump back into Fallout 4 to check out mods? Let us know in the comments below."

Disney Remember that moment from ""The Force Awakens"" when you first saw Darth Vader's destroyed helmet and all the memories from the first Star Wars trilogy and the Sith Lord's heavy history mingled with the new film? You can recapture that feeling at home if you manage to buy one of Disney's limited-edition replica props of Vader's melted helmet. The helmet is crafted through a complex process detailed in a behind-the-scenes video. It involves computer modeling, 3D printing and lots of hands-on time from skilled prop makers. Disney says the helmet ""appears virtually identical to the piece used in the film"" thanks to the use of the 3D digital data from the original prop. The melted helmet is just one replica in a line Disney calls Ultimate Studio Edition collectibles. Other props include an FN-2187 Stormtrooper helmet complete with bloody streaks, Kylo Ren's helmet, Poe Dameron's X-wing helmet, Chewbacca's bowcaster and Rey's staff.

Born in 1899, she was one of the pioneers of animation, and is widely credited with having made the world's first full-length animated film, ""The Adventures of Prince Achmed,"" in 1926. What made Reiniger's style unique, and what is being celebrated in today's Google Doodle, was her inspiration: from a very young age, she was fascinated with the shadow puppetry of China. Her films were created using intricately detailed shadow puppets, filmed using a technique we would now call stop motion, moving the puppets a little bit at a time between frames. She also developed and used in the world's first multiplane camera, a piece of technology further developed and used by Disney in 1937 for ""Snow White."" She directed her first film in 1919, and went on to make nearly 60 films in her idiosyncratic style in her career, many of them based on fairy tales. Only around 40 of these films survived; when the left-leaning Reiniger and her husband Carl Koch fled Germany in the 1930s as the Nazis rose to power, she had to leave much of her work behind. Reiniger died in 1981, but her legacy was an important one. ""No one else has taken a specific animation technique and made it so utterly her own,"" wrote Philip Kemp of the British Film Institute. ""To date she has no rivals, and for all practical purposes the history of silhouette animation begins and ends with Reiniger."""

Here are the portraits: ""The Cursed Child"" is set 19 years after the last Harry Potter book. Based on a story by original author J.K. Rowling, the play is written by Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, with Imogen Heap providing the music. In this video, Rowling, Thorne and Tiffany give us a glimpse of rehearsals: Previews for the two-part play begin at London's Palace Theatre on 7 June, followed by official opening performances on 30 July. If your chimney flue won't carry you all the way to the West End, a book of the script will also be available.

Continental Tire Right now, natural rubber has its grip on the tire industry, pun ever so delightfully intended. It's only grown in a single corner of the world, and as vehicle sales continue to rise, it's smart to invest in ways to reduce our reliance on this small-batch natural resource. Enter Continental Tire and, of all things, the dandelion. There are certain properties in natural rubber that synthetics cannot match. But the latex that is used in rubber production can be found in more than just the rubber tree. For example, it can be found in a specific Russian species of dandelion, the roots of which contain a source for natural tire rubber. The dandelion in question can be grown outside the ""rubber belt,"" and it's less sensitive to weather. You don't need to displace food crops to grow it, either, and moving away from the rubber tree's natural habitat cuts down on shipping costs. And, as a cherry on top, it only takes a year to cultivate the dandelion, whereas rubber trees take about seven years before producing natural latex. Continental Tire's goal is to get these tires on the road in 5 to 10 years, and its parent company is looking into using this new source of rubber in other vehicle components, further reducing reliability on a single tree in a single part of the world. Sorry, Hevea brasiliensis, but we're just not that keen on you anymore. You're just too picky."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7pFGgpGhGs/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8XODAJAmmg"

Quincy PD/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET I know you want to shove an iPad into a one-year-old's hands so that you can have some time to Facebook your friends. But have you thought through the consequences of your little ones being au fait with all gadgets and their uses? I mention this only because of Robbie Richardson. He's six and he used a phone to report his dad to the cops. The police in Quincy, Massachusetts were only too delighted to release the 911 call in which Robbie told the dispatcher: ""Um, daddy went past a red light."" To add a little color, he explained: ""He was in a brand-new car, my mummy's car."" Robbie, who was calling from a cordless phone at home, wasn't shy to add even more details. For example, dad was allegedly hurrying to the car wash. The dispatcher was amused, but not too amused. He asked to talk to dad. So, as the Boston Globe reports, Robbie carried the phone to his dad and told them the authorities wanted a chat.

""A police officer must observe the violation to issue the ticket or give a warning."" It can be useful, of course, for kids to know how to call 911 in case of an emergency. But you have to think through all the potential ramifications of your kid's mental machinations. Kids can be depressingly honest. Some even have a disturbingly draconian streak. You don't necessarily want them to communicate your every foible and habit, particularly to the authorities. Still, Robbie's dad might listen to his son more carefully.

Cinemax I really wanted the demon to possess me. I can't resist those YouTube jump-scare videos of placid roads where suddenly a creepy corpse leaps out, and I liven up my errands by listening to the Reddit NoSleep podcast in the car. In short, I like being (safely) scared. But sadly, the much-touted interactive online trailer for Cinemax's new horror TV show ""Outcast"" just didn't want to play. ""Outcast"" is the story of a man possessed by a demon, and the marketing agency behind the site told Adweek it used immersive virtual audio and eye-tracking software to make fans feel as if they're really under the demon's spell. (Warning: send your kids to PBSKids.org or somewhere else, this site definitely isn't G-rated.) And the show has a perfect horror pedigree: it's based on a comic by ""Walking Dead"" creator Robert Kirkman. Enlarge Image Even demons have technical difficulties. Screenshot by Gael Fashingbauer Cooper/CNET So I went to possessionbegins.com, hooked up my headphones and shut my eyes as instructed. The trailer was supposed to know when my eyes were closed, and during that time, hiss weird little messages in my ears. When I opened my eyes, it was supposed to switch to unnerving footage from the show. Except nothing much happened once I got up the nerve to close my eyes. A few crows cawed, and I eventually opened my eyes to see a message noting that my demon was having trouble tracking me, perhaps due to too much light/not enough light/eyeglasses/or hands or hair in the way. I took off my glasses, tried again. Moved to a different chair. Tested my webcam. Finally, I switched to controlling the demon with the computer spacebar, which admittedly worked pretty well, though I think it probably would've been a little scarier had my own eye blinking registered and the demonic events followed suit. RELATED STORIES Directors can track how that film makes you feel ""Nevermind"" review: When your own heartbeat is used against you When your eyes are shut, the demon whispers creepy little messages and you hear sounds as if your body is being mangled and tossed around. When you open your eyes, you see nightmarish scenes, presumably from the show, including a bloody pentagram carved into some poor soul's skin. The scenes are unnerving, sure, but it's the disturbing demon voice whispering into your head while your eyes are closed that really makes it. Pretty neat experience for those of us who crave things that go bump in the night, even if my eyes were beyond the demon's control. You can also watch a traditional trailer for ""Outcast"" (below), and tune in to the premiere on Cinemax in the US on Friday, on Foxtel in Australia on Saturday and on Fox International in the UK on June 7. But if you're a horror weirdo like me, give the interactive trailer a try. Maybe my demon was just out to lunch."

And even one of the movie's stars, Melissa McCarthy, said it was confusing. In an atmosphere of such angst, who are you going to call? Why, that famed performer Kobe Bryant. The just-retired NBA star revealed on Thursday that he enjoys a cameo in an ad premiering on Thursday during the NBA finals. There he is, all suited up in Ghostbusters gear and ready to what? Flop, perhaps? (I mean ""flop"" in the basketball sense, of course.) Should you be surprised to see Bryant -- not the most popular NBA star ever -- in such a work of art, please don't be.

You will be able to see for yourself when it's released July 14 in Australia and July 15 in the US and UK. The film, a reboot of the '80s franchise, features an all-female crew of Ghostbusters and is directed by Paul Feig. I understand, however, that Bryant himself isn't in the movie. He's just a fan of the original. I fancy this will be the first step toward Bryant taking on leading roles in other remakes. Or at least in ads for other remakes. And no, I'm not thinking of something low level like ""Space Jam."" I'm thinking ""A Star Is Born."" Or perhaps ""Flash Gordon."""

Bosch Self-parking systems like the one on the new BMW 7 Series or Tesla's own Summon technology are handy, but limited. You can't have a complicated entry or exit procedure, really only making the tech useful for tight spaces if you can pull straight into them. But one of Bosch's latest innovations does away with all that, although a bit of human effort is still required. Home Zone Park Assist is one of the technologies that the German company recently showed off, and it puts us that much closer to true autonomous parking. Using a smartphone app, a stereo camera and ultrasonic sensors, the system will navigate tricky, complex park jobs without the driver being in the car. The only catch is that the driver must first navigate the route manually, in order for the system to ""learn"" and repeat the route. The driver can be as much as 328 feet away from the car, so long as the smartphone is still connected to the vehicle via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Bosch claims this system will be on a vehicle in the next two or three years, although it declined to mention which model will carry it first. Bosch rolled out some other interesting systems recently. The company has developed a kind of pedestrian detection, a highly detailed surround-view camera system and low-speed reverse braking. Bosch is also working on an overhead clearance assist, which uses a stereo camera to determine if a vehicle carrying something on its roof will be able to clear upcoming obstacles."

Enlarge Image Elon Musk. I wonder who's his controller. Recode/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET On good days, we know we're insignificant. We're incompetent at so many things. We struggle to remember basics like washing, eating and not annoying others. And we often kill each other for no reason whatsoever.Some explain this human frailty by suggesting there's a deity that controls it all, one who looks down upon us, strokes his gray beard and ruefully shakes his head.Elon Musk has another idea. Answering questions at Recode's Code conference Wednesday, Tesla's CEO admitted he'd thought a lot about the idea that we're all merely participants in one big simulation. After all, he said, games used to be merely rectangles and dots. Now, we're plunging headlong toward a reality that's augmented. ""If you assume any rate of improvement at all,"" he said, ""then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is now."" I can feel gamers licking their lips. I can feel other humans suddenly experienced a drying sensation in the mouth. Musk extrapolated: ""So given that we're clearly on a trajectory to have games that are indistinguishable from reality, and those games could be played on any set-top box or on a PC or whatever, and there would probably be billions of such computers or set-top boxes, it would seem to follow that the odds that we're in base reality is one in billions."" How logical. How thrilling. And how awful. Might, though, discovering that we're just dim Sims be a relief to us?

So maybe we should be hopeful this is a simulation, because otherwise we are going to create simulations indistinguishable from reality or civilization ceases to exist. We're unlikely to go into some multimillion-year stasis."" Some might feel the need to poke a couple of holes in Musk's thesis. They might suggest games are mere human constructs that show the limitations of humanity. No higher power needed.

Fans may be happy to learn, then, that Harmonix and Fender are staying partners for a long, long time. The two companies today announced a licensing deal that lets Harmonix use the Fender brand in Rock Band 4 and potentially other games until 2027. The other big piece of news today is the release of the teaser video below, which suggests a new Fender bass guitar is on the way. ""Rock Band is all about living out your rock n' roll fantasies, on stage, under the lights, in front of a crowd,"" Harmonix CEO Steve Janiak said in a statement. ""For decades, Fender's iconic designs and signature sound have made them the guitar and amp of choice for many of rock's greatest stars. ""Naturally Fender has also been the guitar of choice for many of Rock Band's aspiring rock stars dating back to the series' introduction in 2007. I'm thrilled that they'll continue to be a part of Rock Band well into our next decade."" Fender business development executive Mark Van Vleet said in a statement that ""Harmonix continues to impress us with their attention to detail and precision in faithfully recreating our classic instruments."" 2016 is poised to be a big year for Rock Band 4. The game is getting its first paid expansion pack this fall. It comes with music library improvements including the ability to filter by genre and rate songs, as well as many more features that Harmonix will talk about more during E3. They sound like major, game-changing features. ""Actually huge stuff in store here,"" community lead Josh Harrison said at PAX East, adding that the expansion is inspired by expansion packs for Destiny and World of Warcraft. He went on to describe the features as ""really huge and brand-new."""	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7pFGgpGhGs/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://www.youtube.com/embed/08aTIiN7350"

Here's today's look-twice, then look-again, then share-on-Facebook adventure. Is that boat floating on the water, or flying through the air? It brings up memories of old ""In Search Of"" episodes about The Flying Dutchman or the Mary Celeste, haunted ships with mysterious crews. More optical illusions This brick-wall optical illusion is giving the Internet fits A cat in a desert is your new optical-illusion obsession This short video was posted to YouTube on Wednesday by a user who knew exactly what caused the illusion. ""Snapchat I took of a rare Fata Morgana Mirage at Cocoa Beach, FL,"" wrote YouTuber Friends N Feeders, who then linked to the explanation of a Fata Morgana. Wikipedia offers up the technicals: rays of light are bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. But almost more interesting is its history: named for sorceress Morgan le Fay of King Arthur legend, these mirages were once believed to lure sailors to their deaths. While the Cocoa Beach mirage is short and sweet, there are better examples of a Fata Morgana online. Especially good is this nice sharp one from 2010, which shows a sailboat really cruising along, apparently in thin air. Watch it long enough and you'll inevitably have your attention drawn to the GIANT APPLE on the beach. The poster says that's from a TV commercial being filmed that day. Or maybe that's what Morgan le Fay wants you to think."

Torture, rape, beheadings, poisonings, sure, but outside of a well-placed Tyrion zinger, not too many folks are breaking out in giggles. Well, Ramsay Bolton, maybe, but then again, any old castration or flaying will put him in a laughing mood. But thanks to the three ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" alums who formed Rifftrax, fans are about to see the lighter side of ""Game of Thrones."" On Friday afternoon, Rifftrax released their first humorous commentary meant to be played over a ""Game of Thrones"" episode, in this case, the first episode of the first season. (Hey, Ned Stark! I'm sure things will work out great for him!) Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, who used to crack wise over B-movies on cult favorite ""MST3K,"" now ably do the same for a mix of B-movies, blockbusters, outdated educational shorts and even some TV shows, but this is their first trip to Westeros. For $2.99, fans can purchase an MP3 of Rifftrax jokes that overlay the whole first episode, but have to obtain the episode themselves. And the Riffers are in fine form. Nelson gets in an early dig at fanatic fans, exclaiming as the show opens, ""This is already different from the book! Childhood ruined!"" When a woman walks towards newlyweds Daenerys and Khal Drogo with a chest of writhing snakes, Corbett chimes in with, ""Yeah, see this is why you have to have a wedding registry."" And when Arya catches a sight of the Hound in his fearsome fanged armor helm, Murphy notes that ""Furries were scarier then."" The direwolves, ""winter is coming"" tagline, and Khal Drogo's excellent eyeliner skills all come in for mocking. The Rifftrax crew will reunite with their former ""MST3K"" castmates and comedian Jonah Ray, host of the ""MST3K"" revival, on June 28 at the State Theatre in Minneapolis. That performance will be simulcast to theaters nationwide that night and again July 12."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7pFGgpGhGs/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://www.youtube.com/embed/90AlVPvlRcE"

The super-funky Ecto-1 is the iconic vehicle from the 1984 ""Ghostbusters,"" but the reboot film made a few changes to the design. Sony Pictures released a short video on Wednesday giving us a closer look at the latest long, mean ghost-fighting machine. Related story New 'Ghostbusters' trailer lets the phantasms fly amok Director and co-writer Paul Feig talks about how the main thing he wanted to see carried over from the original ""Ghostbusters"" movie was the Ecto-1. The car from the first film was a 1959 Cadillac design that would have been used as an ambulance. The new Ecto-1 is a 1984 Cadillac hearse. It doesn't sport the crazy fins of the '59, but it's definitely still in the land-yacht vein.

""At 1129 hours this morning [Tuesday],"" it said, ""a monkey climbed on the roof of Gitaru Power Station and dropped onto a transformer tripping it. This caused other machines at the power station to trip on overload resulting in a loss of more than 180MW from this plant which triggered a national power blackout."" Such were the words of KenGen, Kenya's national power company, after an incident that seems to veer between the disastrous and the comical. A monkey got into a power station and accidentally blew the power for the whole country. This was less a military coup than just sheer monkeying about. KenGen says that power has now been restored. It added on Facebook: ""KenGen power installations are secured by electric fencing which keeps away marauding wild animals. We regret this isolated incident and the company is looking at ways of further enhancing security at all our power plants."" KenGen didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment. It might seem odd to some that a monkey found it so easy to disrupt a whole nation's power supply without even knowing it.

""As a city boy from Seattle, I had a lot to learn! It's pretty clear to me that just about anyone who's living in extreme poverty is better off if they have chickens."" Gates goes on to spell out the importance of poultry to the poor, and why his foundation is working toward creating sustainable market systems for poultry in sub-Saharan Africa. And through a partnership with Heifer International, he wants readers to help out. ""If you read this article, watch the video above, and answer one question below, I will donate -- on your behalf via Heifer -- a flock of chickens to a family in poverty,"" Gates promises.

During a livestream event, Bungie confirmed that, as rumored, Rise of Iron will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. All of the game's previous expansions were released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well. Rise of Iron launches on September 20, priced at $30. However, it does also require the Destiny base game, as well as The Dark Below, House of Wolves, and The Taken King. ""Rise of Iron is an exciting addition to the Destiny universe,"" Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said in a statement. ""We are continually blown away and inspired by the growing Destiny community's energy and enthusiasm."" The expansion includes new areas, including The Plaguelands and Felwinter Peak. Additionally, the Destiny starting area, The Wall, has been recreated as a new area you can revisit. Players will also find a new raid, new and updated strikes, and more patrols and public events. Multiplayer fans may be happy to learn, too, that there will be more Crucible maps and features, while Rise of Iron also adds new CG and in-game cinematics. Additionally, Rise of Iron comes with a new Light level increase (an unspecified ""significant Light increase,"" developers said) and a new ""mutated"" enemy faction of the Fallen. One of the new weapons is a ""flaming waraxe,"" which is an ""encounter-specific weapon,"" developers said. This suggests it may not be available in Crucible matches. Here is what it looks like. Activision In terms of story, here is the official description: ""Guardians must rise to the challenge to take their place as the next generation of Iron Lords. Along the way they will join forces with a legend from humanity's Golden Age to defeat a plague of unstoppable evil once and for all."" Also during the livestream event, Bungie confirmed that the fan-favorite Gjallarhorn weapon is returning for Rise of Iron. Everyone can get it by completing a mission, while people who preorder will receive a limited-edition black and silver version of the gun. Similar to past Destiny expansions, there will also be items exclusive to PlayStation players for a period of time. Bungie did not announce this content today, but said more details on this, and other things related to Rise of Iron, are coming ""at a later date."" At the end of the livestream today, Bungie teased that more details may be shared at E3 2016 next week. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Rise of Iron. Looking ahead, Bungie will release a Destiny sequel in 2017; according to a report, the game was recently rebooted."

Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5759bce0d48d0828044e941d"	"After 18 years, Ubisoft shutting down its studio in Morocco - CNET"	"Cnet"	"Ubisoft announced today that it will close its studio in Casablanca, Morocco.

Over those 18 years, the developer has contributed to more than 26 games, including mobile and portable versions of games such as Valiant Hearts, Child of Light, and Rayman Legends. The studio is closing down as a result of the evolution of the video game market, Ubisoft Mobile executive director Jean-Michel Detoc said in a statement. ""We didn't find a sustainable formula for the studio within our broader network,"" he explained. Ubisoft's statement continued: ""The decision to close Ubisoft Casablanca was taken as part of Ubisoft's constant efforts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its cross-collaboration studio model.""

I remember this. Apple UK; YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET These days, Apple's ads are pleasant enough. You don't talk about them like you used to, though. Times have changed. Apple has aged. It's not a simple company anymore. Soccer, though, is simple. It's one of the most elemental sports there is. And Friday sees the start of the Euro 2016 European soccer championship in France. This may not matter to you. You might be more interested in the US' fate in the Copa America, currently occurring on these shores. Apple's UK arm, however, released an ad on Thursday that very simply reminds you how important soccer is to the world. Well, most of the world.

'Harry Potter' actors get sorted into Hogwarts houses - CNET"	"Cnet"	"Of course, Harry, Hermione and Ron are natural Gryffindors through and through. Right? Well, there was that stuttery moment when the Sorting Hat suggested Harry might do well in Slytherin, but honestly it's tough to imagine the three Harry Potter heroes wearing anything but the red and gold. Not quite the case, though, for the actors in the movie. Author J.K. Rowling's site, Pottermore, features an online quiz that sorts users into the four Hogwarts houses, and some of the movie's stars recently got surprising results. Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the films, had the confidence of a born Gryffindor going into his test. ""Well, it'd have to be Gryffindor, I think,"" he said. ""That's what I feel, I belong there."" So much for intuition. Grint was sorted into the loyal, patient and hardworking house of Hufflepuff, and like a true Hufflepuff badger, made the best of it. ""I feel pretty good,"" he announced. ""It wasn't what I was expecting."" Matthew Lewis, who played Gryffindor Neville Longbottom in the films, also joined Grint in switching to Hufflepuff -- and revealed during the sorting process that he'd never snitch on a cheating friend. Evanna Lynch played Ravenclaw Luna Lovegood in the films, but was another one apparently misplaced by Hollywood. She turned out to be not a Ravenclaw after all, but a Gryffindor, which had her pumping her arm in the air in excitement. ""Thrilled!"" she said. What of Bonnie Wright, Ginny Weasley in the show? Would Ron's sister join him in the leap to Hufflepuff, or would Harry's future wife stay Gryffindor through-and-through? ""I think, as a strong, devout Weasley, it could only be Gryffindor,"" she said before taking the online test. And the Sorting Hat agreed. ""I feel very relieved, I feel proud,"" Wright announced upon seeing her results. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione) have yet to publicly take the test, but perhaps the biggest Sorting Hat switcheroo came in 2015, when actor Tom Felton (Harry's nemesis, Draco Malfoy) announced his results on Twitter. It's the kind of result that makes you question the whole house system, actually, and Felton knew it."

Crazy blockbuster movie salaries broken down - CNET"	"Cnet"	"Ever sit and watch all of a movie's credits roll by, all the way through to the names of the animal wrangler, the alien-language dialect coach, and the assistant to the hairdresser for the stand-ins? And then shuffle to your battered Honda Civic in the theater parking lot figuring all those folks are living the good life in Beverly Hills mansions with infinity pools and private jets? Just me, then? Vanity Fair decided on Wednesday to break down the salaries of everyone mentioned in the credits for a hypothetical $200 million movie, and it's an entertaining lesson in reality. There are some whopping sums up front, of course. $4 million for the director. A cool million or so for each producer. $3.2 million for one lucky writer (Stephen King, is that you?) and slightly less for other writers. The lead actor rakes in $12 million, the secondary leads a little less. And then it starts to get funny. An Oscar-winning actor who makes only a cameo scoops up $75,000. The actor playing the ""doctor who delivers bad news"" takes home $7,500. The actor who ""had a scene with the female lead, but it was cut"" earns $1,920, the same as the one who plays ""intimidating bouncer at nightclub."" (I kind of want to see this movie now.) Five thousand uncredited extras make $148 each (they're zombies, aren't they? Zombies have no brains to negotiate). But the movie's cat (is it a zombie cat?) makes $13,000. The cat's Oscar potential is never explained. You can watch the rest of the credits yourself for more gems like that, but just remember: a stunt player who's on fire makes double that of one who just falls through a window."

Some clarification may be not unwelcome here -- just what is ""mixed reality,"" exactly? If you think about entirely computer-generated 3D environments in VR as one extreme, and plain vanilla reality on the other, mixed reality is... well, anywhere in the middle, really. Microsoft's point is that Windows Holographic will support the whole continuum, from light reality enhancements to total immersion - and, crucially, facilitate natural interactions between them. Related Articles Researchers have developed a flexible holographic smartphone screen that plays a mean game of 'Angry Birds' Sorry, Oculus, but HoloLens gets my money Barriers To Augmented Reality Are Holding Us Back From The Holodeck ""Providing devices with the ability to perceive the world, breaking down the barriers between virtual and physical reality is what we call mixed reality,"" wrote Terry Myerson, Microsoft's EVP of Windows and Devices, in a blog post. ""Imagine wearing a VR device and seeing your physical hands as you manipulate an object, working on the scanned 3D image of a real object, or bringing in a holographic representation of another person into your virtual world so you can collaborate."" No one had to imagine, of course: this shining future was illustrated in a 3-minute video by turns fanciful and practical as to how various types of augmented reality would soon interact. For instance, someone with a Hololens headset may scan and inhabit a physical space and begin interacting with it there. Another person, distant but connected using a VR helmet, can enter the space virtually and experience it that way. Yet another may be holographically present via what can only be called a holodeck. Meanwhile, familiar things like virtual item shops and a chatbot assistant (shades of Clippy) make their appearance as indicators of a pervasive, and familiar platform: Windows 10, natch. There is also to be, I am told, an on-stage demo in which two people do a little real-time virtual collaboration, but as I'm not lucky enough to be in Taipei today and the keynote isn't being livestreamed, we'll add video of that whenever it becomes available. winholo1 winholo2 winholo4 winholo3  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit I talked with Microsoft briefly about the effort, and it's clear the company wants to capitalize on the goodwill and momentum (perhaps unexpected) that Hololens enjoys; It's the rare successful (at least initially) ""category creation"" device. Positioning Windows 10 as the only place where one can truly expect to take advantage of the full gamut of reality-mixing is a prescient move as well; the VR platform wars are sure to be confusing and divisive, but Microsoft intends to make sure they they take place on Windows. The video shows a few things that aren't real, but some are more real than others. In vain did I attempt to make a Microsoft representative place certain things, like the ""next generation hand tracking"" on a real-world roadmap. I did however learn the phrase ""subject to future announcement,"" which is a new one. (Evasive diction is one of the finer arts of public relations and is often indifferently done, but this phrase I approve.) Microsoft also announced a number of partners with which it is pursuing its dream of mixed reality. Myerson listed a few: Today we invited our OEM, ODM, and hardware partners to build PCs, displays, accessories and mixed reality devices with the Windows Holographic platform. We are excited to be working with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, HTC, Acer, ASUS, CyberPowerPC, Dell, Falcon Northwest, HP, iBuyPower, Lenovo, MSI and many others... Just what exactly each plans to contribute remains to be seen. Really, so few people have experienced realities beyond just the original one that it's hard to say what will and won't be needed or desired should the concept break through to the mainstream at all. Partners and interested developers are encouraged to come to convenient Shenzhen in the fall for Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference -- or Taipei, if it's closer."

And really, it's a good sign for the Chinese smartphone maker. Previous generations of handsets have been regulated by an invite system, something put in place by the company early on as it attempted to find its place in a seemingly overcrowded market. All in all, the last few years have been pretty good for OnePlus. Great critical reviews have helped cultivate a loyal fanbase for its high-quality, low-cost handsets, leading the company to issue ""millions of invites over the past two years"" by its fairly broad count. That not entirely exclusive club is about to open to everyone with the June 14th launch of the OnePlus 3, which will arrive sans-invite, saving fans the hassle of endless refreshing and message board begging. And while the company is casting off the system as a relic of the past, there's still a sense of bittersweetness in the  ""Let's talk about invites"" forum post that announced the move: The demand for the OnePlus One was much higher than expected. Some got into a frenzy hunting for invites, while others have complained continuously and loudly ever since. Regardless though, the invite system allowed us to scale our operations and manage our risks to help us grow more sustainably. The big reveal will occur, naturally, in the company's VR environment, The Loop (not to be confused with the Chicago business district), ""which doubles as the world's first global VR shopping experience.""

Since then things have been pretty quiet on the home cleaning front, but that changes today with news that Finland's Freska has acquired Norway's Wipe, signalling its intent to lead the space in the Nordics. Related Articles Hassle Founder Alex Depledge Talks About Freeing The EU Market And Changing Parental Leave Policy On-Demand Cleaning Startup Hassle Merges With Rocket Internet's Helpling Handy Raises $50M Led By Fidelity, Reportedly At $500M Valuation, To Clean Up In Home Services Why Homejoy Failed ... And The Future Of The On-Demand Economy Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, though I understand Wipe's founders are staying on and going forward will run Freska's operations in Norway. In a call, Freska co-founder and CEO Sebastian Heinrichs declined to comment on any other aspects of the acquisition, including whether or not it was all-stock, cash or a mixture of both. He did say, however, that this sets up Freska to be the market leader in Nordics, noting that Rocket Internet's Helpling previously entered Sweden, only to retrench in October, seeing it sell Helpling Sweden to local competitor Tidyapp. At the same time Helpling pulled out of Spain, Brazil, and Canada to focus on U.K., Germany and France as it looks to become profitable. On that note, Heinrichs is positioning Freska, which I understand recently closed a round of undisclosed funding, as a buyer not a seller, with more consolidation expected amongst a plethora of local players in the on-demand cleaning space. ""Big time consolidation in the cleaning industry will take place in the upcoming years. We see us as buyers rather than sellers,"" he says in a statement. ""Home cleaning is a growing industry and a industry that will never vanish - it will sure take on different shapes within the next decades, as now when going from offline to online, but the demand for a clean home will always be there"". I asked Heinrichs what he thought the biggest challenge is for startups, no matter how well-funded, to succeed in the on-demand home cleaning market, and after a long pause for thought he told me it's managing supply and demand, and keeping both sides happy -- something he believes Freska's technology platform is enabling despite home cleaning being at its heart a people not technology business. Here not only is on-boarding cleaners key but also ensuring they have enough work to stay motivated and loyal to the platform. Likewise, customers need to trust the service provided and since the service takes place in people's homes, it's a very ""sensitive"" business, says Heinrichs, and one that has to scale carefully and without destroying the original value proposition along the way. ""The problem some players have faced in recent years is due to a lack of understanding the sensitivity of making home cleaning a business - its very simple: home cleaning is a customer retention game and good retention numbers are created mainly through high quality. High quality will impact your scaling abilities, your profitability, everything. The alternative cost of scaling with the cost of loosing quality is too high in this industry.""

The round was led by Upfront Ventures, with participation from Breakwater Investment Management, Time Inc., Downey Ventures (startup investment arm of Team Downey, the production company founded by Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey), M13 and Sterling.VC. When you subscribe to Loot Crate, you get a monthly box with four to seven mystery items, ranging from toys to clothing to books and comics, all tied into big pop culture and geek franchises. (The company says the majority of its products are exclusive to Loot Crate.) The basic plan costs $13.95 per month, plus $6 for shipping and handling. Founded in 2012, Loot Crate currently has more than 600,000 subscribers and more than $100 million in annualized revenue. And it's expanded beyond the basic plan, with subscriptions focused on anime, gaming, individual franchises like Joss Whedon's Firefly and more. (On that front, Loot Crate is also announcing a partnership with 343 Industries/Microsoft Studios for a new subscription around Halo.) The big funding round suggests that Loot Crate isn't just aiming for that a niche, geeky audience, perhaps because those interests are becoming increasingly mainstream. ""We definitely think it's not just about that kind of stereotypical geek -- we're really going after the big, passionate fan groups,"" said CEO Chris Davis. After all, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones have audiences of millions of viewers, while Disney generates billions of dollars in merchandise sales. The vision, Davis said, includes delivering products that are personalized to your interests -- not in the sense that each Loot Crate subscriber will get a different box, but in the sense of carefully curating what's included in each subscription, then helping each user find ""the right one of our subscriptions for you."" And yes, we can expect the number of plans to continue expanding.

But there are problems to be solved before AR can be truly great. Things that seem simple until you actually try to do them -- like getting that computer in your pocket to understand the basic details of a room that it's in. Where are the walls? Is that weird pointy shadow over there a corner, or just the result of crap lighting? Occipital is trying to solve this by building portable, plug-and-play accessories that turn iPads and other devices into 3D scanning beasts. Strap their Structure sensor onto your iPad, and bam -- it's mapping rooms in 3D and scanning real world objects into 3D models. Want to see how that IKEA cabinet will look in your room without lugging it home, deciphering the instructions, and bashing your thumb with a hammer 40,000 times? Capture the room in 3D and toss a render of the cabinet in. Now they've bought a company to help them move away from needing that standalone sensor -- or at least, from needing quite so many of them out in the wild. Occipital tells us that they've acquired Replica Labs, a team of computer vision researchers that had been working on an apps to give any phone basic 3d scanning capabilities without additional hardware. The purchase price was not disclosed, though we're told it's a mix of cash and stock. Replica was focusing on 3D scanning without additional hardware sensors. Occipital ... builds a 3d scanning hardware sensor. Seem contradictory? The fit here is in the overlap. They can't outright replace the Structure sensor just yet -- instead, they're using data from a Structure 3D sensor to make Replica's tech more accurate. You'll scan a room once with Occipital's sensor to get the granular depth data, then others -- those without the $400 sensor -- will be able to navigate a room in depth-mapped 3D and do augmented reality stuff as if they, too, had a sensor attached. Teachers, for example, could use the Structure sensor to 3D map a class room and all of the students could hold up their phones to see a character bouncing from desk to desk. Or you and your friends could play a castle defense game right on your table, pieces rolling off the edge of your table and onto the floor as your castles fall -- and only one of you would need a fancy, 3d scanning sensor. It's early days for AR, still -- particularly when it comes to stuff like this, where things like full-room mapping and lasers are brought into the mix. But we're about to enter a strange period where some devices are far more capable than others at chewing through jaw-dropping AR. Later this month, Lenovo is expected to debut the first consumer smartphone running Project Tango -- Google's similar effort to bring depth mapping and room scanning to portable devices. Millions upon millions of devices, meanwhile, will have nothing but their RGB camera to rely on for years to come. It makes sense, then, for Occipital to try to figure out how to be the bridge between all of these."

Seene lets you capture 3D models from your phone with a simple smartphone camera. Snapchat could use Seene's format for a brand new category of selfie lenses, a new 3D photo format, and potentially for future virtual reality projects. According to our sources, Snapchat was interested in Seene's computer vision technology and its engineering team more than for its consumer product. As TechCrunch's Matthew Panzerino said when he covered Seene's app back in 2013: ""I'm not sure what kind of future an app like Seene has at scale without the welcoming arms of a larger entity."" So step forward Snapchat as that larger entity, with its ongoing need for novelty to keep its users engaged and sharing fresh content -- the lifeblood of its social platform. Seene's engineering team is led by CTO and co-founder Sam Hare, whose computer vision PhD specialized in real-time applications of the technology for gaming use cases. A note on Hare's LinkedIn profile about the ""deep stack of mobile-focused computer vision tech for structure from motion and 3D reconstruction"" which he helped developed for Seene goes on to say that: ""We have a great deal more R&D in the pipeline which will be released soon. Please get in touch if you're interested in finding out more."" TechCrunch understands that Seene's team, which is split between the U.S. and London, will relocate to Los Angeles, where Snapchat is headquartered. Although not all team members are being acqui-hired -- with at least one senior Seene engineer not joining Snapchat. We also understand the price for the acquisition is low, and that it's a cash and share deal. According to AngelList, the startup had raised $600,000 from Knight Foundation, Kima Ventures, EC1 Capital, OREFA, Scott McPhee, Richard Fearn, Julian Carter and potentially others. Latest Crunch Report Brand New Emojis | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Snapchat declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch about the acquisition. It is not clear whether the Seene app will continue to be maintained. 3D geometry plus virtual experiences There are many different use cases for Seene's technology, but they all rely on the same differentiating factor. Seene scans and reconstructs full 3D geometry on your phone. Unlike Project Tango or Microsoft's Kinect, Seene doesn't need special infrared sensors and multiple cameras. Similarly, Seene doesn't need a cloud backend to process 3D scans and recreate 3D objects -- everything happens on the phone. For instance, you can scan your face in a few seconds and create a 3D selfie: Seene is then well-positioned for true augmented reality features. Most augmented reality apps use your phone's camera to recognize a 2D image (a QR code for instance) and inject a 3D object on your phone display. Seene can go a step further as it can inject 3D objects around real life things. While this is a silly example, the sparkling whirlwind around the can of Dr. Pepper in the following video is quite impressive: It would make a lot of sense to use Seene's technology to improve Snapchat's selfie lenses -- including for advertising purposes. (Snapchat debuted sponsored lenses in fall last year, and charges a pretty penny to advertisers wanting to get their brand on people's faces.) Also last year, Snapchat acquired Looksery to power its selfie lenses. Combining Looksery's technology with Seene's technology would allow Snapchat to create more complex lenses with a real sense of depth. Think ads that people want to touch. Seene also works with the camera at the back of your phone to capture 3D scenes. Combined with your phone's accelerometers, it creates a sort of hybrid between a photo and a video; something more interactive. This was the core feature of Seene's consumer app, a sort of Instagram for 3D scenes: Down the line, there could be scope to use Seene's core technology to create content for virtual reality applications -- an area Snapchat has been rumoured to be exploring. While Seene has touted its tech ""putting your reality into virtual experiences."" Virtual reality is a two-sided coin. While many tech giants are focusing on creating VR headsets, other companies are also working on creating compelling content for these headsets. Seene is well-positioned for the content-side of VR, letting anyone create VR-ready content using a phone. Zooming out, it's clear that computer vision startups remain a big target for talent acquisition as applications for algorithms that enable machines to understand and map the world around them proliferate -- whether it's for 3D selfies or autonomous cars. Earlier this month, for example, Intel picked up Itseez, which makes algorithms for driverless car navigation. While last year it emerged that Apple had quietly bought motion capture tech company Faceshift -- a spin out from the computer vision lab at engineering university ETH Zurich. 0 SHARES"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7pFGgpGhGs/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gLMOpt5invA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"

Even so, I thought the featurette was interesting because it showed that while you might think Warcraft is all about computer-generated special effects, the team built big, practical sets -- something co-writer and director Duncan Jones also illustrated by tweeting a bunch of set photos a few months ago. I suppose I should mention that early reviews for the film have not been kind. I actually got to watch an early screening and interview Jones, so I'll be talking a bit more about my reaction when I post the interview this weekend.

How to join the network Every battle is won before it is fought. This bit of pop wisdom, brought down to us from Sun Tzu and countless motivational speakers, is the koan for a generation of can-do entrepreneurs. But there is another version of this line, one that is less rosy. Every battle is won or lost before it is fought. In the all-singing, all-dancing world of entrepreneurial theatre the important part is the part that nobody tells you. It's the part that you forget when you're at the pitch-off, when you and your friends are eating ramen, when the world turns from ink to pink and gold and blue as you fly across the country to meet VCs. Nobody says you'll lose. This is how we lost the first battle. Raising California When I last wrote about Freemit we were in an interesting place. The team was nearly ten people strong - two Eastern European programmers, a big data guy from Colorado, a young lawyer and a young UX person. There were the founders - Richard Svinkin, my college buddy and a true product guy, Paul, a friend I met at Lamaze class, and myself. We had gotten a little bit of money from angel investors who saw a promising team and we had joined the Alchemist Accelerator. Rich had spent months living in the Valley learning how to pitch and scale and build and we were on the road to lots of great meetings and lots of great results. We were trying to build a remittance product. It was bitcoin based with an M. Night Shyamalan twist. See, we saw an interesting disparity that a lot of people had used individually to make a profit. If you bought bitcoin with one currency and sold it for another, the exchange rates were most often very competitive to legacy systems. That's what we set out to test, build, and scale. One of the primary tools we gained from the Alchemist Accelerator was that a startup is a hypothesis testing machine. You ran a test, you got numbers, and ran another test. You needed something to show. This has always been true but in some eras - namely between 2010 and 2014 - we saw a VC market that would dump dumb money on silly ideas like Clinkle. Then, in 2016, we tried to raise in a market that was down on bitcoin investments generally and where Unicorns were starting to be re-evaluated. VCs were looking for products that had traction, revenue, and even profit. We had none of that. What we have was a dream that we could beat the market by optimizing bitcoin price (and we saw that we could) and that we could beat major players using this technique (again, we saw that we could). And we could even move money at rates competitive to legacy, non-blockchain remittance services around the world. But we needed to asses if the bitcoin markets were liquid enough to support the necessary scale to woo investors. What we learned within a month of talking to very smart VCs was that the risk of bitcoin markets not being liquid enough in the near term was too high and there was no way we were going to survive as a business with that model. Latest Crunch Report Brand New Emojis | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes But we fought. We met with VC after VC and explained our position. Our bet was that bitcoin markets would eventually catch up to our idea. There would be enough transaction volume and high enough speeds to make it work and we explained that we would build the product to target travellers instead of remitters. If you were sitting with your friend in Madrid you could simply Freemit them a few Euro from your wallet. If you wanted to buy flowers for grandma you could send the florist 60 zloty in Poland via Freemit. It would be fast, free, and seamless. Heck, we even had a way to get cash out in India using a point of sale partner. It was an amazing idea. There were three reasons it failed. First, the bitcoin markets couldn't support our dream. Using the amount of BTC we would have to touch would move the markets in very real ways. It was akin to dumping a bowling ball into a bathtub - the effects could be catastrophic. Second, American VCs never felt the pain we described because they were too rich and didn't care. Why did they need our service when they had an Amex Platinum? Finally, we were beset on all sides by regulation. People were getting arrested for operating money transmission businesses without a license and so we couldn't actually launch the product without funding and we couldn't fund the product without launching. Every battle is won or lost before it is fought. We had just started the fight but we had already lost the battle. April Is The Cruelest Month We pitched to nearly 50 VCs and every answer was the same except one. Our former CFO introduced us to an old colleague who saw something in this ragtag team of misfits. That was the last investment we got. We entered what Keith Teare called the Valley of Death. This was a stage after incubation - during which we were energized, funded, and staffed - when we, like all other startups, went to VCs to assess whether or not the business was worth funding. The answer we got, in the end, was ""No."" As the year progressed we decided we needed to regroup. We got rid of the entire team - everyone we had worked with for half a year - and tried to code things ourselves. Our competitors were catching up to our vision and companies like Revolut and Circle launched products that attacked our use cases. They proved that this could be done in different ways but they also put our limitations - geographic, legal, and financial - in stark relief. Our tech lead and CFO both left. Friendships frayed and faltered. It was a tough time. Hoot all you want about confidence, power, and the go-go-go attitude you need to be an entrepreneur: unless you are a fully-blown sociopath this process is hard. We got sick. I gained 20 pounds. I had back pain and panic attacks. There is a clear path from building a startup to mental illness and it's well worth exploring in order to prevent susceptible folks from hitting a wall or worse. But that's a discussion for another post. We learned from our mentors Ash Rust, Hans Reisgies, Ravi Belani, and Edith Harbaugh that because one hypothesis fails that doesn't mean you're on the wrong path. It just means you're asking and trying to answer the wrong questions. Rich and I were working daily from each other's houses and we ran through a number of permutations to figure out the best way forward. We started working with a new tech lead who had a different technical solution that wasn't reliant on bitcoin trading and Rich and I surveyed where the bitcoin/blockchain world was heading. It had changed a lot while we were in our startup tunnel and we had some interesting new ideas. Necessity is the mother of invention. While working through the mechanics of the new technical solution we encountered a serious obstacle. We were stuck... but not for long. The conversation got heated and nearly went off the rails during one meeting in May. That was when Rich stopped everything and said in his deep Brooklyn brogue the best words an entrepreneur can hear. ""Wait a second. I've got an idea..."" The Battle, The War We're not licked yet. But this isn't a story of startup redemption... not yet. We are here bury our first idea, not to praise it. The future is unclear, still, as it always has to be with businesses like this one. But it feels good to explain what happened and how things work in a modern startup. By going through this process and being true to the startup way one failed idea may yet lead to one successful one. And so we take a few more steps forward, take a few steps back, and keep walking. This is the third article in the true tale of startup. It's called Startup Step-By-Step. You can read the rest here.

More posts by this contributor: Embracing the sharing economy for growth in China How to join the network The global drone market has been rapidly expanding, attracting loyal consumers while integrating itself as an emerging pillar in the technological sector. One country that has seen an extremely rapid rise in drone growth in terms of usage and production is China. Already heavily invested in producing intermediate parts for other aerospace vehicles, the Chinese are starting to prove themselves a drone-manufacturing powerhouse -- and eager consumer base. As an up-and-coming sector of technological innovation, in which China invested 1.3 trillion yuan in 2015 (comprising over 2 percent of the GDP), drones are set to bolster the growth of the Chinese economy in the future. Drones and economic growth Drones will continue to support economic growth in China because it is a pillar of technological innovation, something China needs to drive its economy (as opposed to simply mass manufacturing disposable goods). ""Indigenous innovation"" campaigns and programs targeting innovation in the technological sector have been launched by both governmental and private entities. Investors in the U.S. are already seeing the potential for economic growth in this Chinese market, with Intel investing $60 million in Chinese manufacturer Yuneec in August 2015 (with another $67 million in eight other Chinese drone companies that followed). CBInsights reported investments totaling nearly $500 million in the drone sector alone in 2015. Additionally, ZDNet reports drone exports totaling more than US$413 million, with projections slated to only keep increasing. This embrace of technological innovation has allowed drones to become an ever-growing part of technological R&D in China, making it inevitable for drones to become a significant part of increasing China's GDP in the future. Governmental support By enthusiastically embracing technology changes in its systems, the Chinese government is one of the primary reasons drones have been integrated into Chinese society so well. Instead of outright litigation or banning of new technologies, the Chinese government has chosen to regulate them. With drones, China's Civil Aviation Authority released a series of regulations in early 2016, categorizing UAVs into seven classes based on weight and size and setting rules about flying near populated regions. Innovations in drones seek to bring a high-tech approach to bolster the country's lagging agricultural economy. The widespread use of drones by both Chinese civilians and the government will help contribute to economic growth. The Chinese government is using drones for a variety of tasks, from the municipal level all the way to the national stage. Chinese individuals are using drones for aerial photography and construction/real estate purposes, among others, while Chinese companies use drones to protect oil/gas interests and help boost China's agricultural sector. Government services Municipal level Government services on a local level will greatly improve because of the Chinese integration of drones at the village and municipal level. Emergency medical services and public safety mandates will see the most improvement, something that is already happening at the local level. In 2014, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck Ludian County, located in the Yunnan Province in southwest China. This earthquake leveled more than 12,000 homes, killing more than 600 people and displacing another 200,000. Because of the dense rubble and vegetation in the mountainous area, the China Association for Disaster and Emergency Response Medicine (CADERM) teamed with private industry drone pilots to rapidly search for survivors and assess the damage. These UAVs provided responders with a bird's eye view of the damage, allowing them to prioritize their search and rescue efforts. Used in the search and rescue EMS context, the local Chinese government, led in their efforts by CADERM, was specifically able to ""map and monitor a quake-formed lake that threatened to flood areas downstream,"" said PLA Reserve Engineer Xu Xiaokun, which resulted in the proper allocation of time and resources to help save lives. Drones are also being used at the municipal level by Chinese police agencies. Lin Daolin, deputy director of the Police Aviation Administration Office, reports that more than 300 police drones are in use in 25 provinces, helping to patrol areas that are difficult for police officers to access. For example, Huidong County, in Guangdong province in southeast China, was a major production base for the date-rape drug ketamine, and at one time contributed one-third of the drug's circulation in all of China. However, local Chinese police forces have used drones to provide surveillance data and actionable intelligence for raids on drug labs. With more than 1,000 police officers involved, the raid not only yielded a large number of drugs and drug producers, but also local governmental officials who benefited from the drug trade. This is just one example of how the Chinese are using drones to protect their local municipalities. Provincial level At the provincial level, China's use of drones has allowed it to supplement and bolster its pollutant monitoring services and border patrol units. While not as localized as municipal services and not implemented on a nationwide basis that a PRC-wide mandate would carry, the provincial implementation of drones has helped Chinese provincial governments immensely, providing key data and surveillance monitoring for areas that are not normally accessible. The Chinese are also using drones at the provincial level to monitor and help enforce wildlife protection laws. In Hunchun in the Jilin province, located in northeast China, the Jilin Forestry Department is investing 12.8 billion yuan (US$2 billion) to monitor the welfare of the endangered Siberian tigers and Amur leopards. With more than 4,000 square kilometers to monitor, this role is typically not successfully filled by wildlife officers working in the region. However, the integration of drones will allow wildlife officers to ensure that illegal poaching does not occur, while ensuring that ground conflicts between humans and animals do not result in any harm. These drones have a potential to revolutionize the protection of China's wildlife, as well as bolster China's drone economy. Investors in the U.S. are already seeing the potential for economic growth in this Chinese market. Border patrol has been another focus of the Chinese provincial drone community. Chinese border patrol units in Tibet, Xinjiang and Yunnan are using drones to provide aerial surveillance. Difficult to cover with only personnel, and with satellite coverage being funneled for national use, border patrol units have faced difficulties in border monitoring. However, drones, particularly those fitted with electro-optic devices to detect object presence and border range, are allowing these units to function at a higher standard. Additionally, these drones can function year-round on a 24/7 basis, providing border patrol units with the ability to combat both drug trafficking and illegal crossings along China's borders. National level Nationwide governmental services have always varied in China, with different funding parameters allotted to different regions. However, the use of drones changes these parameters, allowing authorities the ability to see and monitor areas that were difficult to access before (with these roles specifically encompassing environmental pollution monitoring and Chinese military use). Pollution is an immense problem in China (it has the most pollutant-filled skies in the world). China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has mandated the use of drones to monitor environmental pollutants in China. These UAVs, armed with high-resolution cameras, provide authorities with the ability to monitor suspect factories and workshops that are excessively contributing to China's pollution problem. Typically, the Chinese have been using ground inspections and satellite remote sensing. However, because these resources are very localized and national, the Chinese have a gap at the provincial level. Drones help fill that gap, ensuring that companies are fully complying with China's environmental protection laws. Provinces participating in these provincial-level programs include Shaanxi (northeast China), Shandong (northeast China) and Henan (central China). In fact, the Ministry of Environmental Protection released preliminary results implicating more than 25 percent of 254 factories reviewed as flagged for further inspections because of environmental infractions. The Chinese are starting to prove themselves a drone-manufacturing powerhouse. The Chinese military has been integrating the use of unmanned aerial vehicles into its military capability at a very high rate. Chinese drones such as the Wing Loong drone of the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group and the CH-3 and CH-4B of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. have been developed as offensive weapons, with the ability to launch missiles and bombs while collecting intelligence for further military movement. China's willingness to adopt this technology at such a fast pace is a testament to the Chinese desire to integrate technology as fast as it can develop it. Additionally, with Chinese company EHang debuting a passenger drone, speculation is rampant about the Chinese military's use of EHang's 184 to transport soldiers to and from the battlefield. Services sector China has also been heavily using drones in the services sector, specifically in aerial photography, construction/real estate and deliveries. Aerial photography and filmmaking Drones are being used by the Chinese for aerial photography and filmmaking. Multiple Chinese wedding photographers' websites tout the ability for couples to have their pictures taken by drone, allowing for a wider photo, incomparable with those taken at ground level. These photographers' relatively small investment has enabled them to take shots only capable with extremely expensive equipment, while harnessing the power of the booming Chinese wedding industry. Additionally, photographers are using drones to create spectacular photo displays seen worldwide, such as Hong Kong-based photographer Andy Yueng, whose pictures of 100 of China's megastructures won the International Photograph Awards One Shot Competition. Construction and real estate Drones in China have also been used for construction and real estate services. DroneBase, a startup funded by leading drone manufacturer DJI, helps rent out drones and their pilots. DJI reports that typical requests for users involve ""real estate promotion, construction, mapping, and terrain modeling."" This is simply because the drone's aerial view far supersedes the costs and liabilities associated with committing individuals to the same task. Additionally, the drone can cover areas farther and higher up than a normal surveyor. Large-scale industries The Chinese large-scale industries of oil and gas, along with agriculture, are also benefiting from the use of drones. Oil and Gas Drones are being used by the Chinese to exercise control over oil/gas resources. China is extremely hungry for energy resources, and its search for them has increasingly led it to rural areas within China and Africa. Chinese companies have used drones for surveying areas for potential pipelines, particularly in rural China, where the local areas are not easily accessible. Additionally, the Chinese government is using drones to expand its command and control of resources in Nigeria, where much of China's oil/gas supply lies. Drones allow the Chinese to be present in areas that would be hard to reach otherwise, allowing them to secure and protect their energy resources. Agriculture Drones that specifically target the agricultural industry are also being developed and unveiled by Chinese companies. Leading manufacturer DJI has unveiled a crop-sprayer drone, designed to spray 2.6 gallons of pesticides over 7-10 acres of farmland per hour. XAircraft Technology is among more than 70 companies trying to introduce drone technology to the Chinese agricultural market. Related Articles The drone race is on Xiaomi unveils its first drone -- and it costs just $450 for a 4K video model EHang reveals plans to deploy its passenger drones for emergency organ deliveries Chinese Drone Startup Yuneec Grabs $60M In Funding From Intel With the Chinese government encouraging innovation in the agricultural drone market through the Planning for Natural Agricultural Sustainable Development authority, the Chinese are tapping into the more than 120 million hectares of available farmland to provide a market for drones, with millions being spent by the Chinese to support drone development. With agriculture being the previous backbone of the Chinese economy, innovations in drones seek to bring a high-tech approach to bolster the country's lagging agricultural economy. Conclusion The Chinese ability to implement drones so seamlessly into their everyday lives points out both the Chinese government's willingness to embrace new technology and the Chinese population's new-found wealth to afford this sort of technology. With China's fascination with technology at its infancy, the potential for technological growth and innovation is huge. The drone market is one that is currently somewhat niche, but if used correctly, will set the Chinese economy's stage for years to come. The Chinese are currently among the world's leading manufacturers, developers and consumers of drones. Who's to say that home-grown innovations in smartphones and solar-powered vehicles, as well as other innovations stemming from involvement in drones, aren't next?

It is part Rock Band, part DDR, but in a karaoke-esque setting. Put simply, VOEZ is an anime-themed rhythm game. You need to tap, hold and swipe as colorful commands fall to the target line. There are only a few different moves, but the difficulty of the game increases as you move on to more and more intense tracks. One thing that felt different to me is how the fall lines shift and move as you play the level. Unlike Rock Band where the gameplay is static, there is something ethereal about how the levels shift, pulsate and expand as you play. Making the game extra challenging, to me at least, were the hard-to-spot white dots and the slide hold that shifts the track as you play. These were the game mechanics that tripped me up the most, but also make it more fun. I was a bit surprised that I not only loved this game but that I was quite good at it. Despite the club-esque dance beats (which made me feel a bit like a DJ), there is something to the rhythmic play of the game that makes it equal parts exhilarating and relaxing. I tried the game on both my iPhone SE and full-sized iPad and learned that Voez is way easier and more fun on a smallish phone. You can enjoy unlimited play of approximately 10 free songs; the remaining songs requiring ""keys"" that you purchase to unlock songs. Songs range from mellow pop, rock or intense techno. Song lyrics aren't in English, but don't worry, you can watch tutorials and navigate the game in four different languages, including English. VOEZ is the second game from Taipei-based developer Rayark International. After their prior hit with Cytus, a similar-styled rhythm game, the company is back with something different enough that it doesn't feel like a sequel, but in the same vein. An important thing to note is that you need to be on Wi-Fi to download the game. The main app will require about 200MB of space, with each additional song taking up another 5MB or so. And that's about it. VOEZ is fun and free on both iOS and Google Play. So the real question is whether or not you like it enough to make space on your phone."

That's what I asked Now You See Me 2 director Jon M. Chu -- after all, you could use CGI to make any trick work on-screen, but doesn't that ruin some of the fun? ""It's always a challenge to shoot magic in a movie because magic really happens in person,"" Chu told me. ""You want to know that there's no strings attached, nothing up the sleeves. So we take big efforts to make as many things practical as possible."" Now You See Me 2, which opens tomorrow, continues the story of the Four Horsemen -- magicians played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and Lizzy Caplan. There's a big heist at the center of the film, but it's also filled with plenty of magic tricks, and Chu said the team worked with magicians to build the props and train the actors. For example, Caplan's new character Lula (replacing Isla Fisher's Henley) is introduced with a fake beheading, something magician Keith Barry went to great pains to execute practically. At the same time, the movie has plenty of CGI, most obviously in that big heist. ""We squeeze a little bit here and there to get that CGI stuff in there,"" Chu admitted. Now You See Me 2 is definitely not a serious story. It's the kind of movie where Woody Harrelson gets to play his own evil twin, and where the final act gleefully introduces a new plot twist every five minutes -- but the plot is driven by concerns about corporate intrigue and electronic surveillance. Why can't we get away from those fears, even in a silly Hollywood story like this one? To answer that question, Chu pointed back to the first film, which he said asked, ""What is magic?"" ""Magic isn't just tricks that you do on the streets,"" he said. ""Sometimes people use it to get your money ... sometimes advertisers use it to get you to buy something, make you feel if you get this thing, this fragrance, you're going to draw in girls. Or if you wear this thing, you're going to feel more special.""

""I think that's a great concept for these superheroes,"" Chu said. ""But their superpower is storytelling and manipulation and psychology.

Blippar's visual search tool can recognize hundreds of millions of items, at least on a category level. Some of these items are simply recognized as 'building' or 'skirt', whereas other items can get hyper-specific, like flora and animals. Visual search, as opposed to searching through Google or Siri, is based around curiosity. If you aren't entirely sure what you're looking at, it may be difficult to find the right words to describe and ultimately search for that object. With the redesigned Blippar, the company has built a layer on top of that initial search to let you keep learning through curiosity and discover. Whenever you pull up a Blippable item, the app's interface with spread to a web of bubbles, each with some relation to that original Blipp. Users can click around within this web to see various items relation to one another, or scroll down to get more in-depth information on a single subject. For example, if I blipped a can of Pepsi, Blippar might bring up the founding story of the company, news it pulled in recently from the web, information about the general manufacture of soda, and probably Coca-Cola, among other things. As you click around from one Blipp to the next, you can end up wandering from one topic to another for quite some time, each with its own in-depth write-up. Blippar uses more than 100 sources to deliver this information, but wouldn't specify who it has partnered with on content. You might wonder how Blippar, which has traditionally focused on building out advertising for brands and publishers, might monetize a feature based around curiosity without the app being dominated by ads. Blippar CEO and founder Rish Mitra explained that brands have no control over their Blippar search results. They may show you an ad before the results appear, in the form of a meme or video, but can not control the search results that accompany a Blipp of their product. In other words, Pepsi can't exclude Coca-Cola from its search results. Blippar, founded in the UK, has been around since 2012 and raised a total of $99 million across three rounds of funding. You can check out Blippar now."

Chopra and his co-founder Poonacha Machaiah have been talking about Jiyo for a while, but today the app is generally available on iOS and Android. We got a quick demo yesterday, with Machaiah explaining that one of the goals is ""no typing"". Using data from the sensors in your phone and other fitness devices, Jiyo gives you tips for brief tasks that are supposed to improve your well-being, like doing a stretch after a long flight, or meditations and other routines that might improve your sleep if you haven't been sleeping well. The app includes social features, plus content from health and wellness experience like Dr. Dan Siegel, Dr. Mark Human, Kimberly Snyder and Eddie Stern. In addition, Jiyo is partnering with Gallup to offer a StrengthsFinder that helps users identify and reinforce their personal strengths, and it's partnering with Mindbody to offer access to a wellness-related classes and activities. Related Articles Deepak Chopra Backs Art Marketplace GlobeIn Deepak Chopra Talks About Mindfulness And The Future Of Government Mission 360 is a VOD platform for yoga, meditation, fitness classes Chopra said he's hoping Jiyo can extend the reach of his ideas from millions of people to more than one billion. ""I've always had this idea, I don't know why, but the idea was that if I could reach a billion people and help them personally transform, we would have social transformation,"" he said. ""Because society is a function of a critical mass of people with similar intent. If I want a more peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier and happier world, then we have to be the change we want to see in the world, as Mahatma Gandhi said."" Jiyo is free, but it will include recommendations and options for purchasing outside products and services, and it will eventually add paid, premium features, Machaiah said."

UberRush launched back in October of 2015, offering same-day delivery of items through the app. It was a basic courier service, with deliveries via both Uber cars and bike messengers. In January, the company took it a step further with the launch of a private API, letting retailers bake same-day delivery right into their apps and websites. These partners included Nordstroms, 1800Flowers, Google Express and others. Today, however, Uber can power same-day delivery for almost anything thanks to the UberRUSH open API. From Uber's blog post: With a variety of endpoints and features, the RUSH API acts as a simple solution for companies looking to build or streamline last-mile logistics. Now anyone can build on-demand delivery right into an existing business - or dream up something completely new. To kick off the launch of the API, Uber is holding workshops the week of June 27 in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York. Uber has been working on this for quite some time. In April of 2015, we reported on leaked documents that should a wide-scale merchant delivery program. This program would allow an Uber driver to pick up an item at a store and tuck it in the trunk, pick up a person and complete a fare, and drop off the original item at its final destination in a single trip. Two birds, one Uber driver. Of course, this puts Uber even more squarely in the ring with Postmates, which has integrated directly with a number of retailers like Starbucks, Chipotle, and Apple. Plus, Postmates has been getting more aggressive with non-food retail deliveries. Still, Uber's network of driver partners and its powerful logistics platform could take the on-demand economy to a whole new level."

The report by Sky News reveals the group can potentially recommission thousands of missiles that Western governments assumed had become redundant through old age. The organisation, also known as Isis, Isil or Daesh, is apparently able to produce fully-working remote controlled cars to act as mobile bombs."

Facebook finally made a modern way to view panoramas and VR photos with your phone. Its new feature ""360 Photos"" rolls out tomorrow on iOS, Android, web, and Gear VR, and it will democratize creation of 360 and VR content. Upload an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy panorama, or photo from 360 apps or cameras like the Ricoh Theta just like any other image, and Facebook will convert it into a 360 photo. People who see a 360 photo with the compass icon can scan around it by tilting their phone or click/tap-and-dragging. And those with a Gear VR handy can hit the ""View in VR"" button in the top left corner, pop their phone into the headset, and look around by moving their head. Facebook already has celebrities and publishers lined up to share 360 photos. You'll be able to check out the International Space Station with NASA, look out a crowd of 100,000 fans while standing beside Paul McCartney, or go behind-the-scenes at the Supreme Court with The New York Times. The social network's product manager Andy Huang writes that ""We introduced photos on Facebook more than a decade ago, and they quickly became one of the main ways that people share their experiences."" But Facebook believes video, 360, and VR are the future of sharing, so the feed is adapting. Facebook's history as place to upload user generated content could help it win this frontier of social media. Snapchat doesn't let you broadcast uploads, and Twitter is still thought of as a text-focused platform. But if great 360 content becomes prevalent on Facebook, it could give users another reason to keep coming back each day. Meanwhile, 360 represents a novel opportunity for brands to create eye-catching marketing. Expect movie sets, tourism destinations, and more to end up as 360 photo ads. Facebook first announced the new feature last month alongside the fact that the Samsung Gear VR has 1 million monthly users. But a big problem is that users are running out of content to view from big game and cinematic experience studios. By letting average users create VR-viewable content, Facebook's Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear headsets could stay interesting."

It's called The PHAB2 Pro -- which, well, doesn't seem like the catchiest name. But it's what inside that counts, right? Here's whats inside: Android Marshmallow A seriously huge 6.4'' display running at 2560x1440 64 GB of internal storage 4 GB of RAM 16MP rear camera 8MP front camera 4050mAh battery (with 2.4x Fast Charging) Fingerprint scanner on the rear of the case But most notably, its got a whole array of sensors on the rear that make it ""Tango""-enabled -- the first phone to be able to claim as much. Wondering what the heck Tango is? First announced about two years ago, Project Tango is Google's effort to bring hardcore computer vision capabilities to phones and tablets, giving those devices a sense of where they are in a room and what's around them. Imagine being able to wave your device around to scan a room, creating a full, scale 3d model; imagine augmented reality games that can be played on your table top, characters climbing over and falling off the table's edges. It's still early days, but this video should give you a pretty good idea of what they're going for: The PHAB 2 Pro will be available globally by September, with an off-contract price of $500."

The platform makes kicking off a group chat with your friends, fans and followers as easy as composing a tweet, hitting send and tapping away until your fingers go numb. Until recently, the platform was only available on iOS, but that's changing today with a brand new browser-based interface. ""Twitter is about real conversation in real-time, and Huckle gives every Twitter user the power of instant group chat with their followers,"" Huckle's CEO, Jordan Stone said. ""Our new web app enables our users and their followers to chat from the comfort of a full-size keyboard."" According to Huckle, this is how happy your fans will be if you talk to them using their platform. Would you really deprive them of that unfettered joy? You wouldn't, would you. Related Articles Taylor Swift Will Launch A Concert Documentary Exclusively On Apple Music New NBA platform lets fans create their own playoffs videos Bkstg launches to directly connect musicians with their fans 24 more characters, for better and worse Stone should know the challenges here, too; he used to be the head of digital marketing for Taylor Swift, and has probably seen one or two Twitter conversations take an unexpected turn. ""When a celebrity launches a chat on Huckle, they immediately get fans rushing to chat with them, and it's all right there in an easy-to-navigate format,"" said Stone. ""The current way of doing group chats on Twitter, using retweets and hashtags, is too confusing,"" he says, and adds, ""It's just like a big group text."" The platform is rapidly gaining new users -- I guess it can't harm that Jewel recently embraced Huckle for talking to her fans, and that Drew Scott (of Property Brothers fame) has thrown himself at his fan's mercy using the platform, too."

He was 84 years old. Before becoming an investor, Perkins founded a company called University Labs and was the first general manager of Hewlett Packard's computer divisions. He co-founded Kleiner Perkins with Eugene Kleiner in 1972, helping to lay the foundation for venture capital in Silicon Valley. During his career, Perkins served on the boards of a number of well-known companies including Compaq, Genentech and News Corp. Perkins was also on the HP board, but he resigned in 2006 due to his objections to a board investigation of press leaks. In recent years, he also attracted criticism for a letter in the Wall Street Journal comparing the ""rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent"" to Nazi Germany. (The letter was, in part, a response to negative coverage of Perkins' ex-wife Danielle Steele.)

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

A mere 8% survives due to slow response times of emergency services. The ambulance-drone is capable of saving lives with an integrated defibrillator. The goal is to improve existing emergency infrastructure with a network of drones. This new type of drones can go over 100 km/h and reaches its destination within 1 minute, which increases chance of survival from 8% to 80%! This drone folds up and becomes a toolbox for all kind of emergency supplies. Future implementations will also serve other use cases such as drowning, diabetes, respiratory issues and traumas. Corrective Statement to the video: One should never leave the patient alone and always start performing CPR first. Please send out a bystander to retrieve an AED or Ambulance Drone in case of Cardiac Arrest.

The deadly, insect-sized drones of the future - Unobtrusive, Invasive, and Lethal are here as depicted in this old video The Air Force is reportedly developing winged drones that can sneak up on a suspected enemy as stealthily as a mosquito This is the video missing from this article: http://theweek.com/article/index/240285/watch-the-deadly-insect-sized-drones-of-the-future# A law signed by President Barack Obama in February 2012 directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to throw American airspace wide open to drones by September 30, 2015. Nano sized Drones Combined With DNA Hacking Could Create A Very Scary Future for the United States in light of a law president Obama signed last year implementing a fleet of at least 30,000 spy drones to spy on small town USA no later than 2015 to spy on Americans. Unfortunately this is a true story and as long as we continue to let politicians like President Barack Obama and other democrats pick apart and fundamentally change our constitution instead of protecting it, we move closer to an extreme communist state in our country. In case you didn't know it - and you probably didn't - Congress, with little fanfare, passed an FAA re-authorization bill that President Obama signed into law that will put 30,000 flying drones spying on Americans across U.S. cities by government. People are already nervous about the prospect of being watched by law enforcement (and possibly the military or DHS), but our leaders employ these tools nevertheless and ""we the people"" are letting them. Even the liberal news huffington post has a video news story about this although they try to legitimize the reasons for needing this to save lives. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/drones-unmanned-aircrafts-us-airspace_n_1896839.html The president has ordered 30,000 spy drones to be used within the United States to spy on Americans to be implemented by 2015 We are already seeing evidence of spy drones being used within the United States and NOT for border patrol Government Spy Drone Crashes in Maryland but what about preserving our constitutional rights and freedoms? http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/06/12/recent-crash-raises-questions-about-drone-safety/ MORE SOURCES AND RELATED STORIES: The Future of Drone Surveillance: Swarms of Cyborg Insect Drones - http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/future-drone-surveillance-swarms-cyborg-insect-drones Tiny robot mosquito drones being researched by the US government - http://2tfu.com/2012/06/16/tiny-robot-mosquito-drones-being-researched-by-the-us-government/ National Geographic Story: http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/unmanned-flight/horgan-text Government Working On Mosquito-Sized Drones - http://www.ijreview.com/2012/06/8545-bio-inspired-drones-swarms-of-eyes/ Micro-Drones Combined With DNA Hacking Could Create A Very Scary Future - Business Insider - http://www.businessinsider.com/government-collected-dna-and-future-micro-drones-are-downright-scary-2012-10 USA Today Story: http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-06-19/drone-backlash/55682654/1 Studying butterfly flight to help build bug-size flying robots - http://phys.org/news/2012-02-butterfly-flight-bug-size-robots.html US military developing insect surveillance drones - http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/07/28/253223/us-developing-robot-mosquito-spy-drones/ Video of squadron of nano quad rotor aerial drones - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIMGV5vtd4 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/flying-robots-nano-quadrotor-drones-swarm_n_1249442.html http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/02/01/nano-drone-swarm-shows-off-slightly-creepy-formation-skills/ British Army Using Tiny Drones: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TdbMu8xc4 Drones In U.S.: More Unmanned Aircraft Will Be Flying In Domestic Airspace By 2015 (VIDEO) - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/drones-unmanned-aircrafts-us-airspace_n_1896839.html Washington Times Story over Domesticly Used Drones: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/coming-to-a-sky-near-you/?page=all Snopes reports nano drones true but then brushes it off - http://www.snopes.com/photos/technology/insectdrone.asp"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z78mgfKprdg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/z78mgfKprdg"	"577581a551ac841319ed29b0"	"Drones Sacrificed for Spectacular Volcano Video"	"youtube.com"	"Video technology and science converge on an active volcano in Vanuatu, where explorer Sam Cossman operated camera-mounted drones to capture high-definition images of the spectacular yet dangerous Marum Crater.

The drones were believed to be the SKY-09P, a model made by Chinese company Taiyuan Navigation Technology, a UK newspaper the Register reported. The SKY-09P UAV is 1.21 metres long and has a 1.92-metre wingspan. The small drone can fly up to 4,000 metres and its maximum speed is 100 kilometres per hour. The drones can be fitted with video cameras and digital SLR cameras, making  them effective surveillance tools. Despite their toy-like appearance, South Korea is alarmed by these drones because they were not detected on radar. According to the Washington Post, the UAVs which crashed in South Korea managed to photograph the Blue House, the presidential residence; and several other sensitive areas. The Chinese company denied that it had sold any UAVs to the North Korean regime, but such aircraft can be purchased in the black market. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Fay Collier, manager of the ERA Project in NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate commented on the completion of the first phase of testing saying, ""This project is a huge success. Bottom line: the team has proven the ability to fly tailless aircraft to the edge of the low-speed envelope safely."" Following the installation of a new flight computer in 2010, the X-48B was to continue a new phase of flights tests to investigate controlability aspects. The second phase of flight tests with the X-48B began in September 2010. The X-48C first flew on August 7, 2012. Engine yaw control was among the aspects to be studied.] The X-48C completed its 8-month flight test program with its 30th flight on 9 April 2013. The Boeing X-48 is an experimental unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for investigation into the characteristics of blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, a type of flying wing. Boeing designed the X-48 and two examples were built by Cranfield Aerospace in the UK. Boeing began flight testing the X-48B version for NASA in 2007. The X-48B was later modified into the X-48C version. It was flight tested from August 2012 to April 2013. Boeing and NASA plan to develop a larger BWB demonstrator.

The winning design, ArachnoBeeA, would use cameras and tiny beacons to manoeuvre its way around. How popular drones would be in such a confined space is a different question. 2.760mph trains Hate commuting? Imagine, instead, your train carriage hurtling down a tunnel at the same speed as a commercial jet airliner. That's the dream of PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. His Hyperloop system would see 'train' passengers travel at up to 760mph through a vacuum tube, propelled by compressed air and induction motors. A site has been chosen with the goal of starting test runs in two years. Once built, the loop will ferry passengers between San Francisco and LA in 35 minutes, compared to 7.5 hours by train. 3.Drown forest fires in sound Forest fires could one day be dealt with by drones that would direct loud noises at the trees below. Since sound is made up of pressure waves, it can be used to disrupt the air surrounding a fire, essentially cutting off the supply of oxygen to the fuel. At the right frequency, the fire simply dies out, as researchers at George Mason University in Virginia recently demonstrated with their sonic extinguisher. Apparently, bass frequencies work best. 4.The AI scientist Cut off a flatworm's head, and it'll grow a new one. Cut it in half, and you'll have two new worms. Fire some radiation at it, and it'll repair itself. Scientists have wanted to work out the mechanisms involved for some time, but the secret has eluded them. Enter an AI coded at Tufts University, Massachusetts. By analysing and simulating countless scenarios, the computer was able to solve the mystery of the flatworm's regeneration in just 42 hours. In the end it produced a comprehensive model of how the flatworm's genes allow it to regenerate. Although humans still need to feed the AI with information, the machine in this experiment was able to create a new, abstract theory independently - a huge step towards the development of a conscious computer, and potentially a landmark step in the way we carry out research. 5.Space balloon If you want to take a trip into space, your quickest bet might be to take a balloon. The company World View Enterprises wants to send tourists into the stratosphere, 32km above Earth, on hot air balloons. Technically 'space' is defined as 100km above sea level, but 32km is high enough to witness the curvature of the Earth, just as Felix Baumgartner did on his space jump. The balloon flew its first successful test flight in June, and the company will start selling tickets in 2016 - at the bargain price of just PS75,000 per person!"

The resulting aircraft by Project Wing is larger than many rival drones, with a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft), and is powered by four electrically-driven propellers. So far it has successfully delivered small items, including a first aid kit, candy bars, dog treats, and water to farmers in Queensland, Australia. The prototype Google drone is able to hover above its destination and drops its load on a string. The future of drone delivery, however, remains uncertain. Google has yet to find a commercial partner to bring the technology to the wider public and opponents have voiced concerns over safety and privacy.

The fuel behind the current flurry of interest is that technology and mass production have suddenly brought relatively cheap and sophisticated machines within the grasp of the general public. This misleadingly presents drones as a technology that has solved intelligence gathering problems that have been routine for military or #intelligence #agencies. A report released by the #Columbia #Law #School last year showed the ""reliability and vetting of local informants and foreign #cooperating #government #personnel"" is questionable. Informants are reportedly paid ""$300-$1000 or more"" and there are multiple stories suggesting, ""#Families and rival groups use locator chips to have their enemies targeted and to settle personal vendettas."" Local informants may offer ""sketchy"" information, leading to drone operators firing on people without confirming their identity. And intelligence may be obtained from foreign governments or military officials, who may seek to have the US #target their ""enemies"" instead of the individuals or groups the US wants to target. With #drones, the process may be able to happen more quickly, but the intelligence being used to kill people believed to be terrorists or militants is the product of similar intelligence procedures, which helped the #administration of #President #George W. Bush imprison hundreds of innocent people at Guantanamo Bay. After this part, viewers are exposed to the real truth of why drone use is increasing. Manned #aircraft brings the ""#risk of #pilot #loss."" The story of Francis Gary Powers, who was shot down while flying a #CIA #U-2 spy plane over the #Soviet #Union is presented. His crash is described as a ""propaganda field day for the Soviets."" The plane had ""miles of film"" and so it was easy to see what he was doing. He was imprisoned in Russia for more than two years. This clearly demonstrated ""the need for unmanned spy planes."" Chad tells the audience that ""despite being half a world away from the action, it all feels very real."" It is not like a video game at all. ""There's no reset button. There's no turning it off."" There is the potential to have eyes where a potential attack is going to occur for ""hours ahead of time."" After a target is struck, pilots ""stick around for another few hours to watch what happens afterwards."" He says pilots ""stay focused on the destruction"" they've just caused with their aircraft. The viewer is led to believe that, even though the pilots are initially trained on an XBox controller, there is no feeling of desensitization. Pilots being hired off the street are not enlisting and finding this is like playing #Call of #Duty #video #games at home. Nearly halfway through the program, the audience begins to hear some critical views on the development of this technology. Afghanistan is the ""only publicly authorized war."" Operations in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen are part of covert operations. Peter Singer of the Brookings Institution says America has ""conducted a lot of strikes that would have been problematic if we had used manned systems."" Shuja Nawaz of The Atlantic Council says who the targets were, whether they were actually terminated or if others were killed can often be unknown. The narrator notes there are no ""verifiable counts of civilian deaths"" but that thirty percent of those killed could be civilians and strikes may be turning people against the US and violate international law. #predator #u-2 #design #performance #engine #plane #sensor #terrorist #ISIS #ww3 #spy #monitor #jet #engineer #California #UAV #albatross #fuel #DARPA #HAARP #GPS #amber #NATO #UN #NASA #Afganistan #Iraq #Iran #Syria #Israel #Airforce #newmexico #newgeneration * Subscribe for more Educative & Truth Videos * Like & Share * go to our website http://advexon.tv/ * Share your ideas and comment * WakeUp Channel --- https://www.youtube.com/user/truebiographyhd/ * Documentary HD Channel --- https://www.youtube.com/user/truedocumentaryhd/"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YSqy1jzNydY/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/YSqy1jzNydY"	"577581a851ac841319ed29e9"	"Ancient Technology: ""Well Over"" 2,000 Yr Old Computer, Power Tools, and Drones"	"youtube.com"	"SEE MY ARTICLE HERE: http://b4in.info/gUQA  And, if you copy my video, please be courteous enough and provide attribution as well as my news link above.

Now local law enforcement wants them for police work such as surveillance and search-and-rescue missions. That in turn has sparked a fierce debate over the balance between cutting-edge law enforcement technology and the privacy rights of citizens. In February, Reason TV covered an Alameda County, California public protection committee meeting in which Sheriff Gregory Ahern announced that he planned on using a laptop-sized drone (he prefers to call it an ""unmanned aerial system"") for search and rescue. ""It's mission specific to search areas for lost children or elderly or Alzheimer's patients to search an area that it would be very difficult for our personnel to get to,"" said Sheriff Ahern. Residents and civil liberties advocates are skeptical that drone use would remain so narrowly defined for very long. At the meeting, Linda Lye of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California took issue with the sheriff's submitted draft of a privacy policy. She it's not specific enough about what the sheriff can and cannot do with drones. ""If the sheriff wants a drone for search and rescue then the policy should say he can only use it for search and rescue,"" said Lye. ""Unfortunately under his policy he can deploy a drone for search and rescue, but then use the data for untold other purposes. That is a huge loophole, it's an exception that swallows the rule."" Lye urged the public protection committee not to approve the drone until stricter safeguards were in place. She pointed out that the safeguards were important because the technology will develop very quickly - and possibly to a point where citizens don't have control of their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Indeed, Alameda County could serve as the baseline for police and sheriff's departments across the country, so getting it right there may affect all Americans. The sheriff plans on applying for permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly aircraft above 400 feet and plans to pay for the drone with a federal grant. MuckRock.com made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the grant made to the Department of Homeland Security in July 2012. The request revealed that Sheriff Ahern was looking to purchase a drone equipped with a something called a ""Forward Looking Infrared camera."" These thermal-imaging devices detect radiation given off by heat from people or animals, opening up a wide variety of concerns. Criminal law experts such as Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School say law enforcement hasn't been given enough legal guidance on drones yet. ""If you say we're going to use it for a manhunt, what do you call a manhunt? If you say you want to use it to find missing persons, well, how far can you go with that?"" says Levenson. She says that it's a matter of drawing lines because it's just too easy to become Big Brother without them. What happens, for instance, if police capture evidence of unrelated criminal activity while searching for a lost toddler? Can they use that to trigger arrests and prosecution? Trevor Timm of the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out that it is very hard to draw lines with police because, once police have a certain power, they never want to give it up. ""Police always seem to want to push the boundaries as far as the law will take them and sometimes over those boundaries,"" says Timm. He points to law enforcement and cell phone data as an example. The New York Times reported in 2012 that law enforcement made 1.3 million demands in 2011 of phone companies for subscriber locations, text messages, and other information. Because there weren't strict privacy rules in place when mobile phones first exploded onto the market, it made it that much easier for law enforcement to obtain civilian data without search warrants or users' approval or even knowing about the requests. ""Generally there is this real friction between technology and civil liberties and we haven't really figured out how to deal with it,"" says Levenson. We don't know how to deal with it because technology is developing a lot faster than the law can keep up. Government cameras are everywhere these days and the laws that deal with them go back to the time of the framers of the Constitution. ""What did they know about drones?"" asks Levenson.

Try a little polivation | Lisa Ellman | TEDxBeaconStreet"	"youtube.com"	"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. There's a lively debate about the about the domestic use of drones.  From package delivery to cropdusting to filmmaking and business security... There's a drone for that!  As quickly as the innovators are developing new ways to use the technology, policymakers are curbing and restricting their use in the interest of public safety. Lisa Ellman, Obama Administration veteran and pioneering drones policy advisor, believes that government policy and entrepreneurial innovation work best together.   She believes the key to balancing these opportunities and challenges is a true integration of policy and innovation, which she calls ""Polivation"". Policymakers must promote innovation, and innovators must work hand in hand with policymakers. This compelling talk from TEDxBeaconStreet teaches us how our country can make good use of new technologies, including drones, in a way that wins the public's trust and serves its interests. Nearly eight years ago, Lisa Ellman began working for her former law professor - Barack Obama. Since then, she has held a variety of positions at top levels of the Executive branch at the White House and Department of Justice; most recently, she led the DOJ's effort to develop policy that would govern the use of drones in the U.S. Ms. Ellman is now in private public policy practice at McKenna Long & Aldridge and chair of the firm's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Practice Group. There she uses her experience in the federal government to help bridge the sizable knowledge gap between government policymaking and business innovation.

NASA and Verizon to Monitor US Drone Network from Phone Towers"	"youtube.com"	"www.undergroundworldnews.com Exclusive: Federal agency is developing technology to track commercial and civilian drones via cell coverage, with first tests of air traffic control system set for this summer. Verizon, the US's largest wireless telecom company, is developing technology with Nasa to direct and monitor America's growing fleet of civilian and commercial drones from its network of phone towers. According to documents obtained by the Guardian, Verizon signed an agreement last year with Nasa ""to jointly explore whether cell towers ... could support communications and surveillance of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) at low altitudes"". That $500,000 project is now underway at Nasa's Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley. Nasa is planning the first tests of an air traffic control system for drones there this summer, with Verizon scheduled to introduce a concept for using cell coverage for data, navigation, surveillance and tracking of drones by 2017. The phone company hopes to finalise its technology by 2019. Nasa's new UAS (unmanned aircraft system) traffic management operation is intended to enable safe low-altitude drone flights within the next four years. At the moment, there is little to stop operators flying wherever they want. The agency would like technology that will automatically ""geo-fence"" drones to keep them away from sensitive areas like the White House, ground drones in bad weather, help them to avoid buildings and each other while flying and decide which drones have priority in congested airspaces. According to the documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the purpose of the agreement is to ""jointly explore if cell towers and communications could possibly support Unmannned Aerial Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) for communications and surveillance of UAS at low altitudes"". The focus is ""exploratory"" since ""the requiremements and technology paths [for commercial drones] have not been clearly defined by the FAA"". In February, the Federal Aviation Authority released its proposals for regulating commercial drones. The FAA proposal would allow drones weighing up to 55lb to fly within sight of their remote pilots during daylight hours at heights below 500ft and at speeds of less than 100mph. http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/03/verizon-nasa-drones-cellphone-towers"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xMf2VWT4r5w/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/xMf2VWT4r5w"	"577581a851ac841319ed29f7"	"Future Terrifying Technology (Full Documentary)  Spy Drones..."	"youtube.com"	"Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wakeupnationorg Futurists can dish out some exciting and downright scary visions for the future of machines and science that either enhance or replace activities and products near and dear to us. Being beamed from one location to another by teleportation was supposed to be right around the corner/in our lifetime/just decades away, but it hasn't become possible yet. Inventions like the VCR that were once high tech -- and now aren't -- proved challenging for some: The VCR became obsolete before many of us learned how to program one. And who knew that working with atoms and molecules would become the future of technology? The futurists, of course. Forecasting the future of technology is for dreamers who hope to innovate better tools -- and for the mainstream people who hope to benefit from the new and improved. Many inventions are born in the lab and never make it into the consumer market, while others evolve beyond the pace of putting good regulations on their use. Next, we'll take a look at some sound-loving atoms, tiny tools for molecules, huge bunches of data and some disgruntled bands of people who may want to set all of this innovation back with the stroke of a keyboard.

The drones, called Octocopters, could deliver packages weighing up to 2.3kg to customers within 30 minutes of them placing the order, he said. However, he added that it could take up to five years for the service to start. The US Federal Aviation Administration is yet to approve the use of unmanned drones for civilian purposes. ""I know this looks like science fiction, but it's not,"" Mr Bezos told CBS television's 60 Minutes programme. ""We can do half-hour delivery... and we can carry objects, we think, up to five pounds (2.3kg), which covers 86% of the items that we deliver."" 'Ready to enter' The service will be called Prime Air and comes as Amazon is looking to improve its efficiency to boost growth. Amazon also posted a video on its website showing a drone picking up a package from one of its warehouses and delivering it to the doorstep of a customer's house. However, it still has to wait for permission from US regulators. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. Civilian air space is expected to be opened up to all kinds of drones in the US by 2015 and in Europe by 2016. Existing regulations are in place to minimise the risk of injury to people on the ground, said Dr Darren Ansell, an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from the University of Central Lancashire. ""The UAVs do not currently have the awareness of their environment to be able to avoid flying into people. To deliver goods to people's homes for example in residential areas, the UAVs must overfly densely populated towns and cities, something that today's regulations prevent. ""Other things to consider are security of the goods during the transit. With no one to guard them the aircraft and package could be captured and stolen,"" he said. Amazon said: ""from a technology point of view, we'll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place."" The FAA was ""actively working on rules for unmanned aerial vehicles"", the company said, adding that it hoped the green light would be given as early as 2015. ""One day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today."" Zookal, an Australian textbook rental company, announced earlier this year that it would start using drones to make deliveries from 2015 if approved by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Australian law allows the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial use."

CRACUNS enables new capabilities not possible with existing UAV or UUV platforms. Its ability to operate in the harsh littoral (shore) environment, as well as its payload flexibility, enables a wide array of potential missions. The most innovative feature of CRACUNS is that it can remain at and launch from a significant depth without needing structural metal parts or machined surfaces. CRACUNS gives sponsors and researchers access to possibilities that were previously unavailable. CRACUNS' low cost makes it expendable, allowing for the use of large numbers of vehicles for high-risk scenarios.

This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Alternatively, it can be pre-programmed to patrol areas that aren't covered by static cameras. Carrying advanced image analysis technology, the drone can capture high clarity, identifying images of a perpetrator, transmitting them wirelessly directly to SECOM. Simultaneously, the robot drone is capable of autonomous flight, allowing it to keep a constant distance from a subject, recording and monitoring their movements.

Italy first requested to buy armaments for its two US made MQ-9 Reaper drones in 2012. According to the officials, the US State Department has approved the sale to Italy of 156 AGM-113R2 Hellfire II missiles, 20 GBU-12 laser-guided bombs, 30 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions, and others. Italy would be the second country after the United Kingdom to receive approval to buy armaments for its large US made drones. In February 2015, the US government enacted a new export policy governing the sale of large drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper, and drone armaments, requiring that buyers undergo review by the US State Department. Under the policy, buyers of military drones must agree not to use the drones for unlawful surveillance and may not use the drones to crack down on their domestic populations. Speaking of the government's approval of Italy's request, one official told Reuters, ""It's not a decision we've taken lightly, and it's symbolic of our trust in Italy as a partner."" ""Italy is a responsible member of the international community and they have been with us in every significant recent NATO and U.S.-led operation."" The arms sale to Italy is valued at $129.6 million dollars, with defense contractor General Atomics acting as prime contractor. The US Congress has 15 days to veto the sale of drone armaments to Italy, but is expected to allow the sale to proceed. ------------------------------------------------------------- Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

They recently tested the laser to verify that it works as well out at sea as it does on land, even in heavy fog, wind and rainy conditions. Boeing is creating a laser cannon for the United States military that will be able to take down drones and rockets no matter where it is installed. They recently tested the laser at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida under heavy fog, wind and rainy conditions to verify that it would work as well out at sea as it does on land. The High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator is powered by lithium ion batteries charged by a diesel generator, so as long as fuel is available it will continue to fire indefinitely. It is controlled using only a laptop and an Xbox video game controller. A telescope and infrared wide field-of-view camera are used to locate targets that are then blasted by the high intensity light, which heats up until it destroys the target. Boeing and the US military have been working on this project for several years with a weapons contract for 36 million dollars. They are continuing to develop the technology to give the laser an even higher intensity so it will be able to effectively destroy rockets, mortar strikes, and drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles. The laser cannon isn't expected to be ready for operation in the field until after several more years of development."

We're building Autopilot to give you more confidence behind the wheel, increase your safety on the road, and make highway driving more enjoyable. While truly driverless cars are still a few years away, Tesla Autopilot functions like the systems that airplane pilots use when conditions are clear. The driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car. What's more, you always have intuitive access to the information your car is using to inform its actions."

During the last 10 years the technology that was formerly only available to the military, reached the hands of thousands. Researchers, hackers, enthusiasts and hobbyists helped drive the technology further and higher than anyone had imagined just a few years ago. We will recap what the civilian airborne robot community has achieved in the last decade and what the next frontiers are that need to be addressed. Over the last decade, projects and companies like Paparazzi, Microdrone, AscTec, Mikrokopter, UAVP-NG and others have made small unmanned vehicles (aka. drones) what they are today. Through innovation and hard work, autonomous drones are now affordable and accessible enough that most of us can build one at home. While the companies inspired, the Open-Source projects advanced and shared these multidisciplinary technologies with many engineers and hackers thereby building a collaborative community of innovators from the ground up. Though many challenges have been overcome, we are only at the very beginning of the private UAV revolution. Consider a comparison with the personal computer, which has evolved in ways that could not be foreseen in the beginning. Those working on this platform need space and time to discover the beneficial possibilities. There are many challenges that we are still facing and they are as exciting and basic as the technology itself. Let me take you through a brief history of the developments and advances in Open-Source UAV and try to envision what is still in front of us."

I got the meet with a very safe barrier in between me and these two lion cubs. They're 1 1/2. They were not the cute, furry kinds. They were ferocious. My heart was pounding, even though I had a steel door between me and them. It was really incredible just to see a wild man. They're only going to be there for calm of weeks. They're fattening them up. They're going take them back to the wild and they'll flourish. I met a catacal. I got to hold her. Her name is ginger. She's going to be released as well. They saved her from being shipped off to the middle east. This is an incredible center. It saves so many animals. It's hoping to -- toprevent all of the atrocities exited across the country.

IRGC's three-day missile drill began Monday in the central Iranian province of Semnan. The second and major part of the drill was conducted Tuesday when IRGC bomber drones struck their targets in the Lut Desert in northern Semnan, where medium- and short-range missiles also hit ""simulations of the transregional forces' airbases.""

Verschoor | TEDxJohannesburg"	"youtube.com"	"The rhino poaching scourge persist because of the complex web of issues surrounding it. These include the age-old myths of sexual potency and medicinal efficacy, the market price of the horn itself, inadequate government policies, and widespread poverty in the rural communities surrounding game reserves. But an often overlooked fact is the very real difficulty of protecting rhino over tens of thousands of square kilometres of particularly difficult terrain. Camiel and his team have created technology that combines drones (and satellites), with artificial intelligence and cloud platforms to help the ranger to more effectively scope terrain and track animals. Could this be the answer that game farmers and activists and governments and broader society have all been looking for? Could drones at last put the final nail into the rhino poaching coffin? Camiel is founder and CEO of Dutch UAS, a Dutch startup that builds software to analyse nature reserves and farms. The software creates 3D maps and detects objects (e.g. animals, humans, and cars) in images taken by drones using artificial intelligence. The technology is developed to help rangers combat rhino poaching, but has numerous other potential applications. The Kairos Society recently announced Camiel and his team amongst the top 50 emerging global entrepreneurs to watch. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The South Korean government is taking notice and offering its support to the country's leading research labs and latest startups. Our Choi You-sun reports. While visiting the Korea Aerospace Research Institute on Friday,...President Park took a spin in an unmanned ground vehicle,...or driverless car... developed by Hyundai Motor. She also checked out the country's latest drone technology. ''Korea is the world's fifth-largest auto producer, and seventh in terms of drone technology. If we come up with a strategy and focus on increasing our capabilities, we will be able to catch up to the leading nations.'' For example, drones were recently used for search and recovery in quake-stricken Nepal, and the U.S. has developed a special model that travels inside a hurricane to get real-time data. In Korea, unmanned undersea vehicles are currently used for resources development and to monitor seismic activity on the ocean floor. A growing number of these devices are being used commercially and by private individuals. The global unmanned vehicle market size is expected to expand by 20 percent to 150 billion U.S. dollars over the next 10 years. Referring to this rapid growth, the president urged officials and the private sector to work together,... as time is of the essence. ''Right now, developing the technology is important, but the speed of development is equally important.'' Korea's small drones are already losing price competitiveness against Chinese rivals and developed nations are moving ahead with improvements to the technology. To help the country catch up, the government vowed to cooperate with the private sector over the next three years. The military is expected to start using Korea's high-speed tilt-rotor drone next year and the government has offered more support to Korean SMEs that develop key components for driverless cars.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Vine is a short-form video sharing service. Founded in June 2012, it was acquired by microblogging website Twitter in October 2012, just prior to its official launch. The service allows users to record and edit five to six-second long looping video clips, and revine. Revine is where users can share other peoples posts with followers. Some Vines are revined automatically based on what is popular. The videos can be then published through Vine's social network and shared on other services such as Facebook and Twitter. Vine's app can also be used to browse through videos posted by other users, along with groups of videos by theme, and trending videos. Vine enables users to record short video clips up to around six seconds long while recording through its in-app camera. The camera records only while the screen is being touched, enabling users to edit on the fly or create stop motion effects. Additional features were added to the app in July 2013; these include grid and ghost image tools for the camera, curated channels (including themed areas and trending topics/users), the ability to ""revine"" videos on a personal stream, and protected posts. In July 2014, Vine updated their app with a new ""loop count"" meaning every time someone watches a vine, a number on top of the video will appear showing how many times it was viewed. The ""loop count"" also includes views from vines that are embedded onto other websites. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nwSlqAAd_EM/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/nwSlqAAd_EM"

The Manifold, in its simplest form is something like an Arduino DIY board but one that's been built specifically with drones in mind. It comes with a number of ports for DJI's Matrice including USB, Ethernet, Mini-PCIe, HDMI, UART, SPI, and I2C, that'll allow for a number of sensors and other things to be connected to the drone. On board you'll find an NVIDIA K1 processor with Kelper graphics. It also runs Ubuntu 14.04 LTS out of the box. It's also pretty light, as you'd expect, at just 200g, though that's without anything connected to the device.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, are rapidly evolving to meet both society's and the military's needs in automation and better efficiency. Dr. Missy Cummings, an associate professor at Duke University's Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab, is at the forefront of drone technologies. During her time as one of the first female fighter pilots in the US Navy, Cummings observed that computers could take off and land a plane more precisely than humans. Because of this breakthrough and her fascination with this growing technology, she made a career change and began human-drone interaction research. Despite their promise, people have wide ranging opinions about drones, with privacy issues at the forefront of their concerns. On the other hand, these automated devices are becoming the norm for many work and social environments, such as deactivating a nuclear reactor in case of a meltdown. They can react quicker and more effectively than humans in certain situations, increasing safety. Dr. Cummings discusses her research and her predictions of continuing interactions between humans and computers.

"youtube.com"	"The Ultra-Lethal Drones Of The Future Technology Full HD Documentary 2015! In 13 short years, killer drones have gone from being exotic military technology featured primarily in the pages of specialized aviation magazines to a phenomenon of popular culture, splashed across daily newspapers and fictionalized in film and television, including the new season of ""24."" What has not changed all that much -- at least superficially -- is the basic aircraft that most people associate with drone warfare: the armed Predator. The Predator, with its distinctive bubble near the nose and sensor ball underneath, is the iconic image of drone warfare, an aircraft that grew out of 1980s work supported by the Pentagon's future-thinking Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Originally developed to perform surveillance, the CIA added Hellfire missiles and began using the Predator to hunt down members of the Taliban and al Qaeda after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Though the CIA and Air Force now fly an updated version of the Predator -- named Reaper -- the drone is still relatively easy to detect, and easy to shoot down, at least for a country with a modern military. Modal Trigger A MQ-9 Reaper during a 2009 combat mission over southern Afghanistan.Photo: AP In fact, as terrifying as drones sound, they actually aren't all that sophisticated compared to other weapons in the US arsenal. The original Predator plodded along at a pokey 84 miles an hour. Modal Trigger A ShadowHawk drone with the Montgomery County, Texas, SWAT team. Civilian cousins of the drone are being sought by police departments, border patrols, power companies, and news organizations who want a bird's-eye view.Photo: AP Its missiles, though lethal, are decades-old technology developed to destroy tanks, not terrorists. And despite concerns about autonomous killing machines, the Predator must be operated by a pilot (albeit remotely). The Predator has proved effective, but it is not exactly the sci-fi miracle that many might imagine. Under development, however, is a new generation of drones that will be able to penetrate the air defenses of even sophisticated nations, spotting nuclear facilities, and tracking down -- and possibly killing -- terrorist leaders, silently from high altitudes. These drones will be fast, stealthy and survivable, designed to sneak in and out of a country without ever being spotted. -------------------More video's and Subscribe channel ----------------- The History Of SEX - All Over World (Documentary HD). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187akSlCwdU&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries Internet Sex Trafficking in America is massive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcFOHkXVV64&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries Pornography in Ancient Egypt's Full Documentary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKvnOAnVQsw&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries How Sex Changed the World --- Full HD Documentary 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-GnXIe7k&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries Female Sex Tourism (Full Documentary) Video ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiqbMTs_NA8&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries Why We Should Decriminalize Prostitution -- Full HD Documentary (2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=177wcJ6xkQU&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries BBC -- Hidden killers of the Victorian home watch online https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9450PQOQ-Lo&ab_channel=MindExpandingDocumentaries The Myth of Sex and Porn Addiction (Full HD Documentary 2015). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcDZmqL7vw What Are the Symptoms of Sex Addiction? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJv0r0FqyCY&ab_channel=pkmacklin The Science of Lust, Attraction, and Attachment video ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c5wwZr_p0k&ab_channel=pkmacklin Sex on the German Line -- Full HD Documentary video (2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ8YM2zPFCY"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ML_t8Ep4SDE/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/ML_t8Ep4SDE"

Ranging in size from under a pound to tons, drones carry a host of technologies that enable important work in fields ranging from environmental monitoring to newsgathering, from smart agriculture to law enforcement. From a regulatory perspective, drones raise immense challenges. They are both information technology and aircraft, and sometimes toys. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has consequently struggled to determine what falls in or outside of its mandate of governing flight safety, and is often (and understandably) blind to important policy questions about issues such as privacy or freedom of speech. This conference brings together lawyers, policymakers, and technologists to address how domestic drones as a disruptive technology rupture and bridge existing regulatory frameworks. The goal is both practical and theoretical: to explore how technology drives regulatory development, while at the same time bringing important actors together in the same room to address how the parts fit together--and identify where there are ga"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ea0aMxS_288/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/ea0aMxS_288"	"577581ac51ac841319ed2a4e"	"Drones, DIY Electronics, 3D Printing & More- Tech Live with Eric #36"	"youtube.com"	"Weekly live Tech show right here on YouTube.

Unmanned Aircraft? Flying Robots?!? This is an exciting, new and different kind of technology that enables us to explore new physical spaces and see things from new perspectives. Drone technology is evolving very rapidly - they are becoming lighter, cheaper, and easier to use as they become more technologically advanced. Join this fun, fast, and informative session to learn about drones, why they are an important part of the Internet of Things family, how I hacked my drone into a ""self-flying zombie"", and why security for drones will be critical as we leverage this technology in the future."

The startup pulled in a whopping $34 million in pre-orders by the end of 2015, with 60,000 units already sold. While that's not as massive as Apple Watch pre-sales (1.2 million sold in the first day), it's still a pretty good indicator Lily is onto something. The little flying bot is pretty cute with its rounded style and smizing blue LED lights. The 10.29-inch-wide by 3.22-inch-tall device can fly 50 feet up and comes equipped with a 1080p HD camera. Lily acts as a robot videographer, automatically following you anywhere. It starts recording videos as soon as you toss it into the air and is even waterproof, should you want to take it to the pool. A small tracking device lures Lily along as it uses technological wizardry to find the perfect shot.

A group of researchers from Korea have developed a way to operate unmanned drone by simply touching your clothes. Sohn Jung-in has more. A robot spider crawls across the room. But it's not operated by a joystick. Instead, the controller simply presses a device on the cuff of his clothing to move the robot in the direction he wants. And this unmanned aerial drone,... it starts to fly at the command of a man touching his fingers while wearing some special gloves. The secret is in a smart fiber sensor that allows the user to control the devices through the amount of pressure they apply. ''We attached the pressure sensor onto the fingertips of gloves, and programmed it so that when pressure is applied, the user can control the robot's movement wirelessly.'' The smart fiber sensor thread, which is coated with nanoparticles, looks no different from regular thread. This means it can be attached to virtually any type of clothing. ''The thread we made can be used as a wire and as a sensor. It's thinness and versatility means it can perform a number of functions when attached to regular clothing or gloves.'' The research team is in the process of filing for domestic and overseas patents. It plans to commercialize the touch-activated technology within three years. Sohn Jung-in, Arirang News."

The system uses biosensor technology to track the flow of oil and follows the spill while simultaneously releasing bacteria to degrade the pollutant, thereby streamlining the cleanup process and preventing the pollution from spreading further.

However, over the few last years a new generation of drones has emerged focused on supporting humanitarian and civilian actions. For example, NASA uses drones to collect data on tropical storm intensity, and drones were used to produce aerial imagery during the 2013 Colorado floods. In India, UAVs made a reconnaissance of 50 flood-affected areas in Uttarakhand, where at least 20 areas had been inaccessible to relief workers. While the costs of acquiring drones have gone down and societal benefits are significant, the public use of drones poses a number of unique challenges. This session provides a platform to explore how drones can be used as an effective tool for mapping, surveying, 3D modeling, and enhancing search and rescue operations in the aftermath of a disaster, and to discuss how to build broader government acceptance on the public use of drones."

In 13 short years, killer drones have gone from being exotic military technology featured primarily in the pages of specialized aviation magazines to a phenomenon of popular culture, splashed across daily newspapers and fictionalized in film and television, including the new season of ""24."" What has not changed all that much -- at least superficially -- is the basic aircraft that most people associate with drone warfare: the armed Predator. The Predator, with its distinctive bubble near the nose and sensor ball underneath, is the iconic image of drone warfare, an aircraft that grew out of 1980s work supported by the Pentagon's future-thinking Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Originally developed to perform surveillance, the CIA added Hellfire missiles and began using the Predator to hunt down members of the Taliban and al Qaeda after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Though the CIA and Air Force now fly an updated version of the Predator -- named Reaper -- the drone is still relatively easy to detect, and easy to shoot down, at least for a country with a modern military. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Watch More Interesting videos and documentaries ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Future of Glasses Wearable Technology 2015 Full Documentay Video ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpfcUpMxYqo Future Soldier - US Army Future Military Technology Full Documentary Video 720HD ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDFLtGoYyR4 911 - Seconds From Disaster Documentary Video 2015 ! www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J-tzc3ByUY How Our Beliefs Affects Our Body And Biology Full Documentary Video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYiFSL4GwRg Deep Sea Exploration Full Docuemntary HD Video 2015 ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBqxoaZi4vM India's Ancient Sciences & Technological Innovations Redicovered Full Documentary Films! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akfOf3ZsXXY Future Technology Unbeatable Army U.S. Army in 2050 Full Documentary Film ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uStetYDA28E Ancient Hidden Technology of the Annunaki (Fallen Angels) Amazing Documentary ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iszAGQrc8LE Bomb - Top Secrets about Nuclear Bomb - Full Documentary Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSEqYAjVMaA"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M0PataHUc6w/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/M0PataHUc6w"	"577581ad51ac841319ed2a70"	"Anti Gravity Autonomous Drone Technology--Drone Star Exposed!"

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, as an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), or by several other names, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator, or fully or intermittently autonomously, by onboard computers.[1] Compared to manned aircraft, UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too ""dull, dirty or dangerous""[2] for humans. They originated mostly in military applications, although their use is expanding in commercial, scientific, recreational and other applications,[3] such as policing and surveillance, aerial photography, agriculture and drone racing. Civilian drones now vastly outnumber military drones, with estimates of over a million sold by 2015.

It's not just on or off, manual or autonomous. You can tailor Smart Shots in real time to work for you, using as much computer-powered flight or camera control as you need to bring your creative vision to life. 1. You Do It All - Fly and film like any consumer drone. Control the drone and the camera by yourself, using unique Solo features like preset angles and fine-grain tilt control. 2. Split the Work - You can choose to have your copter's computer be a second operator, either a pilot or cameraman. Let Solo fly itself (locked on predetermined paths for consistent and safe flights) while you operate the camera, or fly yourself while the drone's computer controls the camera for you, easing between keyframes or staying locked on a subject as you Orbit or Follow. 3. Drone Does It All - Quickly set up a shot exactly as your creative mind envisions it (position in space, how the camera pans and tilts, and speed of the shot) and let Solo execute it. Reveal subjects, orbit subjects or ease in and out of two keyframes. No matter how much you're letting your drone do, you can override it at any time, choosing to tweak, tune, shape and direct your shots for ultimate creative control.

Leaky roofs are everyone's nightmare but especially in such a large facility as a Lexus-Subaru dealership. The product installed was GacoFlex coating and not only is it flexible and fire-resistant, it also forms a weather-tight seal to protect polyurethane foam installations from water and UV-light. The product used also has excellent durability, color stability and chalk resistance. Gaco Western is a recognized leader in innovative silicone roofing systems, and offers best-of-class waterproofing and insulation solutions for a variety of commercial, industrial, and residential applications and EZ General is their local and authorized and trained contractor EZ General has earned a reputation and trust in the construction industry as a top-quality roofer using waterproof coatings and insulation products. Great views of the finished project from our drone, a dji-phantom 2, shows the complete scope of the project.

Sixty-one of the 129 companies that received regulatory approval to use unmanned aircraft are using DJI drones, or 47 percent, far ahead of its nearest rival, a Reuters review of federal records as of April 9 shows. Nearly 400 other companies, more than half of the 695 businesses still awaiting approval, have applied to use DJI drones. Shenzhen-based DJI, whose best-selling Phantom 2 Vision+ drone retails for around $1,200 in the United States, estimates that it already has about 70 percent of the commercial market worldwide and a larger portion of the consumer market. Federal records also suggest that DJI is quickly expanding its U.S. market share, thanks in part to a new process speeding federal exemptions for companies that intend to use drones previously vetted by regulators. DJI accounted for about a third of the roughly 50 exemptions granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from last September through mid-March. But it has claimed just over half of the 89 exemptions received since then. Industry experts say basic drones such as DJI's are likely to drive the U.S. commercial market for the foreseeable future, meeting business demand for uses such as aerial photography for site inspections, real estate promotions and video production. The market for more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being limited by FAA policy that restricts commercial drone flights to line-of-sight operations at altitudes of 500 feet (152 meters) or less. Those rules are complicating efforts by e-commerce giants Amazon.com and Google Inc to develop high-tech drones capable of delivering packages over long distances. ""Those limitations effectively rule out larger UAVs, which are not going to be cost-effective with that sort of restriction,"" said Philip Finnegan, the Teal Group's director of corporate analysis. ""It's really going to drive things toward the low end of the market."" The Teal Group expects the U.S. market for commercial drones to reach $5.4 billion in sales by 2023. Founded in 2006 by Chinese entrepreneur Frank Wang, DJI generated nearly $500 million in revenue in 2014, up from $130 million in the prior year. It expects to exceed $1 billion in sales this year and is in talks with investors to raise new capital. A person familiar with the discussions said DJI, valued at $10 billion, is also pursuing partnerships. Ease of use The emergence of a Chinese company as a dominant player in a new U.S. technology market has so far not raised concerns in Congress. Other Chinese technology companies including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. have been accused by U.S. lawmakers of posing national security risks, hurting their chances of building a substantial U.S. business. DJI's U.S. business customers include American International Group Inc, Commonwealth Edison Co in addition to a host of lesser known firms in real estate, insurance, energy, agriculture and film and television. Due to safety concerns, U.S. companies are banned from using drones unless they obtain an FAA exemption. The U.S. aviation regulator proposed rules in February to lift the ban, but final regulations are not expected until late 2016 or early 2017. Since FAA began granting exemptions last September, gains have been limited for DJI's rivals, whose products are often much more expensive. DJI's nearest competitor in the U.S. commercial market is Swiss drone-maker senseFly, owned by Paris-based Parrot, with 8.5 percent of the exempted companies, federal records show. Sensefly's eBee mapping drone package has a price tag of around $25,000. More complex systems made by European and U.S. competitors can cost upwards of $100,000. DJI has gained its market lead without a U.S.-based sales staff. Both hobbyists and business customers purchase drones through online retail outlets and directly from DJI's site, and say they stand out for their ease of use as well as the low price."

Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. ICAO classify unmanned aircraft into two types under Circular 328 AN/190:[1] Autonomous aircraft - currently considered unsuitable for regulation due to legal and liability issues Remotely piloted aircraft - subject to civil regulation under ICAO and under the relevant national aviation authority The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.[2] Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.[3][not in citation given]. The Nazi-German V-1 flying bomb flew autonomously powered by a pulsejet. They are usually deployed for military and special operation applications, but also used in a growing number of civil applications,[4] such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work, such as inspection of power or pipelines. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too ""dull, dirty or dangerous""[5] for manned aircraft.

Tim steps inside the factories and R&D units of the top brands to discover what the future of the car might look like, how it could impact our travel experiences, the structure of our transportation networks, and the ethical issues that will need resolving before robots can fully take control of the wheel. > Subscribe to the Financial Times on YouTube: http://bit.ly/FTimeSubs For more video content from the Financial Times, visit http://www.FT.com/video Twitter https://twitter.com/ftvideo Facebook https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e3DZcrKOQM8/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/e3DZcrKOQM8"	"577581ae51ac841319ed2a84"	"Blade 200 QX BNF with SAFE Technology (BLH7780) - DGDrones.com"	"youtube.com"	"Blade 200 QX BNF with SAFE Technology (BLH7780) http://dgdrones.com/medium-size/902-200-qx-bnf-with-safe-technology.html Roger highlights the features of the  Blade 200 QX for DGDrones.com."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Sixty-one of the 129 companies that received regulatory approval to use unmanned aircraft are using DJI drones, or 47 percent, far ahead of its nearest rival, a Reuters review of federal records as of April 9 shows. Nearly 400 other companies, more than half of the 695 businesses still awaiting approval, have applied to use DJI drones. Shenzhen-based DJI, whose best-selling Phantom 2 Vision+ drone retails for around $1,200 in the United States, estimates that it already has about 70 percent of the commercial market worldwide and a larger portion of the consumer market. Federal records also suggest that DJI is quickly expanding its U.S. market share, thanks in part to a new process speeding federal exemptions for companies that intend to us, last September through mid-March. But it has claimed just over half of the 89 exemptions received since then. Industry experts say basic drones such as DJI's are likely to drive the U.S. commercial market for the foreseeable future, meeting business demand for uses such as aerial photography for site inspections, real estate promotions and video production. The market for more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being limited by FAA policy that restricts commercial drone flights to line-of-sight operations at altitudes of 500 feet (152 meters) or less. Those rules are complicating efforts by e-commerce giants, ""Those limitations effectively rule out larger UAVs, which are not going to be cost-effective with that sort of restriction,"" said Philip Finnegan, the Teal Group's director of corporate analysis. ""It's really going to drive things toward the low end of the market."" The Teal Group expects the U.S. market for commercial drones to reach $5.4 billion in sales by 2023. Founded in 2006 by Chinese entrepreneur Frank Wang, DJI generated nearly $500 million in revenue in 2014, up from $130 million in the prior year. It expects to exceed $1 billion in sales this year and is in talks with investors to raise new capital. A person familiar with the discussions said DJI, valued at $10 billion, is also pursuing partnerships., DJI's U.S. business customers include American International Group Inc, Commonwealth Edison in addition to a host of lesser known firms in real estate, insurance, energy, agriculture and film and television., Since FAA began granting exemptions last September, gains have been limited for DJI's rivals, whose products are often much more expensive. DJI's nearest competitor in the U.S. commercial market is Swiss drone-maker senseFly, owned by Paris-based Parrot, with 8.5 percent of the exempted companies, federal records show. Sensefly's eBee mapping drone package has a price tag of around $25,000. More complex systems made by European and U.S. competitors can cost upwards of $100,000. DJI has gained its market lead without a U.S.-based sales staff. Both hobbyists and business customers purchase drones through online retail outlets and directly from DJI's site, and say they stand out for their ease of use as well as the low price. ""Everything just works. A lot of other systems require you to tweak all the settings and parameters,"" said Paul Callahan, chief executive of New York-based SouthGate Films, which won FAA approval this month to use a DJI drone for aerial photography including solar panel inspections. Some lawmakers, including Senator Charles Schumer of New York, have called on the FAA to ease flying restrictions so drones can be used for a wider array of business applications. Lawmakers have also argued that restrictions on outdoor drone testing have put U.S. companies at a disadvantage to foreign rivals, which operate in less restrictive climates overseas,"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fqm_fHdIsLg/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/fqm_fHdIsLg"

The annual technology event is set to showcase over 3,500 exhibitors including big tech companies like Sony, Samsung and LG. STORYLINE: For people who love the latest technology, CES is the place to be. Visitors and tech experts are set to pour into the exhibition halls of Las Vegas this January, coming face to face with the very latest gadgets and gizmos the world has to offer. The International CES is claimed to be the world's gathering place for all who thrive on the business of consumer technologies. Organisers says this year's event is set to attract 3,500 exhibitors, including manufacturers, developers and suppliers of consumer technology hardware, content, technology delivery systems and more. There's set to be more than 150,000 attendees from more than 140 different countries. Having gained a reputation for dictating the year's tech trends, it's now the job of others in the industry to anticipate the key talking points for 2015. ""CES is the biggest consumer electronics show on the planet,"" says Michael Gorman, the editor-in-chief of Engadget, a technology web magazine. ""And there's always going to be phones and tablets and laptops and washing machines, the stuff that people know about. But there are tremendous amounts of technology that are maybe a little less useful, but are equally interesting and maybe even cooler than a lot of the stuff that you see. So, it might not be something that you'll buy but it's fun to know about. It's the kind of things you see on Facebook or Twitter or whatever. It's just like, this is insane. I can't believe that this exists."" According to Gorman, ultra-high definition 4K televisions are set to dominate this year. With screens that house four times more pixels than regular HD TVs, many consider Ultra HD to be the future in terms of home viewing. But so far, lack of content and high prices have meant many are yet to make the jump to 4K. Last year, both Samsung and Sharp unveiled 4K models. South Korean tech makers LG Electronics have already confirmed they'll be showing off their new webOS 2.0 Smart 4K TV platform at this year's event. ""Of course there's always going to be lots about TVs,"" says Gorman. ""4K, it was a big thing last year. I think it's going to continue to be a big thing this year as well. I think it's probably going to be more about content this year. The TVs already exist, the prices are coming down a little bit more. I think this year it's really going to be about what are we going to watch on those big beautiful screens we've got."" From rings to bracelets to watches and headsets, wearable technology is set to take on countless forms at CES 2015. With South Korean tech makers Samsung having taken the plunge into wearable technology in the form of their Galaxy Gear smart watch, others are set to follow suit. Many are expected to show off their own take on the wearable trend at this year's event before US tech makers Apple release their own smart watch in early 2015. ""There's a much larger opportunity in real wearable things, whether it's rings and jewellery or actual clothing that has sensors,"" says Gorman. ""There's conductive thread that can actually make clothes have some electronic sensors built into them. So I think that's really going to be the one that will break away from the wristband form factor."" Whether it's in your car or in your home, smart connected technology is set to get people talking in Las Vegas convention centres this January. One of the overriding trends in technology last year was connectivity. Automotive tech will also be a big talking point at the event.

Each item is tested in field on a working flying drone.  Our team discovered a unique laminated material that is strong as carbon fiber and light as wood for our line of Torpedo frames.  Using this technology along with 3d printed parts creates a clean and unique type of craft. Torpedo Drone frames are designed to fly. The laminated material is strong and light. Using a 3D printer gives us at MCD (c) the ability to create some very unusual and unique flying craft. Printing out our parts offer you different colors that you can mix or match. Our line of drones uses our own special made type of down draft tubes that can be used for landing gear or wired for led lighting. The 4302 and the 700 uses the same plates.  By buying the 4 inch wood arm you will get a 430 mm class ship. Buy the 8 inch wood arm and you can have a flag ship that can handle 16 inch propellers. We take great pride in making sure our products ""work"" before we list them or advertise them.  ""Fly something different"" is our motto. Take one of our frames for a spin and you will see why we say this."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uyaVYJ7q5-g/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/uyaVYJ7q5-g"

The military role of unmanned aircraft systems is growing at unprecedented rates. In 2005, tactical- and theater-level unmanned aircraft alone had flown over 100,000 flight hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, in which they are organized under Task Force Liberty in Afghanistan and Task Force ODIN in Iraq. Rapid advances in technology are enabling more and more capability to be placed on smaller airframes, which is spurring a large increase in the number of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) being deployed on the battlefield.

Peter-Paul Verbeek, University of Twente, project length one year (2016-2017) Consortium partners: UAV international, Clear Flight Solutions Top sector: High Tech Systems and Materials (HTSM) The rapid expansion of drone technology and its applications makes it important to develop tools that connect the development and testing of drones with ethical and legal analysis. Drone technologies make it possible to perceive and to act on a distance, which has many societal implications. In public discussions, military drones have come to play a dominating role, but there are many other types of drones, raising various ethical and legal issues. Drones for surveillance and crowd control, for instance, raise issues of privacy, chilling effects and liability. Drones for (parcel) transport, earth observation and remote sensing, raise issues of environmental nuisance and public safety (EASA, 2015). One of the specific concerns is the combined use of manned and unmanned flights at smaller airports, due to the lack of air traffic control. In this project, we aim to develop a tool that can be used for analyzing the ethical and legal issues related to the development and use of drone technology. More specifically, it will be a tool that can be used (a) to anticipate how a drone-in-development might have an impact on individual users, social practices, and societal processes; (b) to analyze the normative (legal and ethical) dimensions of this impact; and (c) to bring this analysis to technological and regulatory design processes. The tool combines insights from philosophy of technology (technological mediation, Value Sensitive Design) with a precautionary approach in legal design. This happens in close interaction with actual practices of drone development, testing, and use. *Responsible Innovation programme* The Responsible Innovation programme funds and encourages research that considers the ethical and social aspects of new technology from the design phase onwards.

Drone ships will become key part of Royal Navy as they replace manned vessels for minesweeping and anti-terror missions, says top commander Commander Peter Pipkin said tests on unmanned craft was 'exciting stuff' He spoke ahead of Unmanned Warrior, a demonstration for naval drones Around 40 companies from around the world will be involved in test event Machines will demonstrate how they could revolutionise military's maritime future The Royal Navy's top commander says seaborne drones will soon replace sailors on minesweeping and anti-terror missions as they become 'critical' to naval warfare. Peter Pipkin, the navy's most senior technology officer, said work being done on unmanned and autonomous craft was 'some of the most exciting stuff the navy has done for some time'. Mr Pipkin made the predictions to The Times at a preview for the Unmanned Warrior, a demonstration for seaborne drones off the Scottish coast in October. Around 40 research and development companies from around the world will test their latest developments in an operational setting - which will include anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and reconnaissance tests - near then Outer Hebrides. The machines will then compete in their own version of 'robot wars' to demonstrate how they could revolutionise the military's maritime future. The event will provide a glimpse into the innovation now embedded in the navy's approach and how new technology could be paving the way for drone ships as part of everyday missions. At the show, one company will be trialling the world's first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is capable of landing autonomously on a moving ship. Roke Manor Research (Roke) has developed a technology called 'Autoland' which uses cameras and modelling so that a UAV can self-land without the need for human assistance. Another technology on show will be the Sonobuoy, which can be deployed en masse to search for enemy submarines. The Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft (Sharc) and AutoNaut drone will also be tested for their submarine-hunting skills. The Sharc, which has an array of sensors and devices, is designed to travel thousands of miles out at sea without a single crew member on board. The technology - which is completely silent - is propelled by ocean waves and has no energy restrictions, meaning it last on missions for up to a year. On show will also be The ATLAS Remote Combined Influence Minesweeping System, an unmanned boat which launches minedetecting drones into the sea. Over the past few years, several drones have been tested by both the Royal Navy and on the other side of the Atlantic. In May last year, a 3D printed drone was launched from the gun deck of the Royal Navy's HMS Mersey before landing safely on a beach in Dorset. The unmanned aircraft, which weighs 3kg (6.6lbs) and has a wingspan of 1.5 metres (4.9ft), flew autonomously for five minutes along a pre-programmed route. In March this year, the US Navy tested a radical 'drone boat' that will automatically scour the seas for enemy submarines for months at a time. The Navy hopes the 'sea hunter' will end the growing threat of quiet, diesel powered enemy submarines entering American waters undetected. Countries from Europe to Asia have been looking into developing fleets of unmanned ships to cut down on operating costs but the idea has sparked debate over whether it's possible to make robotic boats safe enough to run on their own far from land. The International Transport Workers' Federation, the union representing more than half of the world's more than one million seafarers, has said it does not believe technology will ever be able to replace the ability of humans to foresee and react to the various dangers at sea. -~-~~-~~~-~~-~- Please watch: "" Michelle Obama arrives in Spain to promote girls' education"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpslZKoaVt8 -~-~~-~~~-~~-~-"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SMI2bq_7ERo/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/SMI2bq_7ERo"

Today, of course, these are well-developed, pervasive technologies. Even more mind blowing is the thought that emerging technologies including drones, driver-less cars, and 3D printing could soon become a norm. It's important to know the costs and benefits of utilizing emerging technologies, since they could soon become commonplace.  Seeing that these technology, in fact, are steadily becoming ubiquitous, it'll be to your benefit to ensure your business is covered by an Indiana Cyber Liability policy. Benefits of Using Emerging Technologies Individuals and businesses embrace new technologies because they increase efficiency and make tasks more convenient and effective. Drones, for example, are being tested as efficient ways to deliver packages and gather information. Telemedicine (connecting patients and physicians via Skype and other platforms) is a viable solution to the problem of a lack of healthcare access in certain areas. Driver-less vehicles promise to significantly cut down on personnel costs for companies that operate large fleets of vehicles. As the list goes on, technology innovators are spurred on by demand for innovative solutions. Costs of Using Emerging Technologies Of course, along with the benefits of upcoming technologies come plenty of risks. Some risks are more obvious than others: self-driving cars could become involved in accidents. Drones could crash and/or collect data that leads to privacy-related lawsuits. Doctors diagnosing over the internet rather than in person are prone to misdiagnose. Surprisingly, the flexibility that emerging technologies allow can also negatively affect businesses. Mobile technologies are pervasive yet their capabilities are still emerging. When IT management firm SolarWinds surveyed nearly 300 IT industry professionals, these professionals ranked mobility as the emerging technology most disruptive to small businesses. With more flexibility at their fingertips, employees are more prone to distraction.

What has not changed all that much -- at least superficially -- is the basic aircraft that most people associate with drone warfare: the armed Predator. The Predator, with its distinctive bubble near the nose and sensor ball underneath, is the iconic image of drone warfare, an aircraft that grew out of 1980s work supported by the Pentagon's future-thinking Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Originally developed to perform surveillance, the CIA added Hellfire missiles and began using the Predator to hunt down members of the Taliban and al Qaeda after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Though the CIA and Air Force now fly an updated version of the Predator -- named Reaper -- the drone is still relatively easy to detect, and easy to shoot down, at least for a country with a modern military.

Nations have been using drones in combat since at least World War II, and they've made up an important part of the aerial arsenal ever since.  In the last two decades, however, the massive expansion of communications bandwidth has combined with the ongoing miniaturization of electronic components to produce a Golden Age of UAV technology.  Drones, once relegated to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, have become star players in the U.S. Wars on Terror, and now play critical roles in the military establishments of many nations. What countries have made the most of the drone age?  Some of the answers are unsurprising; nations with huge investment capacity and ongoing military conflicts have obvious advantages in the ability to develop drones, and to develop ways of using them for strategic purpose.  This article looks at the five nations that have most effectively taken advantage of the Golden Age of the Drone, with more of an emphasis on how these countries have managed innovation, organization, and deployment than on the characteristics of specific weapons."

It's part of a broader overhaul of the economy as China seeks to vault into the ranks of wealthy nations. But it comes as the country's growth slows amid tepid global demand that's adding pressure on tens of thousands of manufacturers. With costs rising and profits shrinking, Chinese manufacturers will only be able to survive in the near future by successfully transitioning from the current labour-oriented mode to more automated manufacturing. Shenzhen Rapoo Technology Co. is among the companies at ground zero of this transformation. At its factory in the southern Chinese industrial boomtown of Shenzhen, orange robot arms work alongside human operators assembling computer mice and keyboards. The company began its push into automation five years ago. Rapoo installed 80 robots made by Sweden's ABB Ltd. to assemble mice, keyboards and their sub-components. The robots allowed the company to save USD $1.6 million each year and trim its workforce to less than 1,000 from a peak of more than 3,000 in 2010. Such upgrading underscores the grand plans China's communist leaders have for industrial robotics. President Xi Jinping called in a speech last year for a ""robot revolution"" in a nod to automation's vital role in raising productivity. Authorities have announced measures such as subsidies and tax incentives over the past three years to encourage industrial automation as well as development of a home grown robotics industry. A relentless surge in wages is adding impetus to the automation revolution. China relied on a seemingly endless supply of cheap labour for decades to power its economic expansion. That equation is changing as the country's working age population stops growing and more Chinese graduate from university, resulting in a dwindling supply of unskilled workers, annual double-digit percentage increases in the minimum wage and rising labour unrest. Rapoo's wage bill rising 15-20 percent a year was one big factor driving its use of robots, according to Pboll Deng, Rapoo's deputy general manager.

An assembly line is a manufacturing process in which parts (usually interchangeable parts) are added to a product in a sequential manner using optimally planned logistics to create a finished product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods. The assembly line developed by Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous in the following decade through the social ramifications of mass production, such as the affordability of the Ford Model T and the introduction of high wages for Ford workers. Henry Ford was the first to master the assembly line and was able to improve other aspects of industry by doing so (such as reducing labor hours required to produce a single vehicle, and increased production numbers and parts). However, the various preconditions for the development at Ford stretched far back into the 19th century, from the gradual realization of the dream of interchangeability, to the concept of reinventing workflow and job descriptions using analytical methods (the most famous example being scientific management). Ford was the first company to build large factories around the assembly line concept. Mass production via assembly lines is widely considered to be the catalyst which initiated the modern consumer culture by making possible low unit cost for manufactured goods. It is often said that Ford's production system was ingenious because it turned Ford's own workers into new customers. Put another way, Ford innovated its way to a lower price point and by doing so turned a huge potential market into a reality. Not only did this mean that Ford enjoyed much larger demand, but the resulting larger demand also allowed further economies of scale to be exploited, further depressing unit price, which tapped yet another portion of the demand curve. This bootstrapping quality of growth made Ford famous and set an example for other industries."

PASCO offers unique robotic solutions for pail palletizing designed to operate 24/7 with minimal supervision and operation. This system includes a fully automatic pallet dispenser that can handle multiple pallet sizes. Pallet centering and squaring is used to ensure that the pallet is in the correct place for the robot. This system has three infeed production lines but only two products that need to be palletized. The middle line can run either product, depending on demand. This system from PASCO utilizes a diverting conveyor to align whichever product is in the middle production line onto the correct palletizing infeed. Pails pass through a bail orientation device to ensure all bails are uniform when the pails are palletized. A clamshell pail-centering device ensures that the pail is properly nested for the FANUC M-410iC/185 robot to make a clean pick. The four-axis FANUC M-410iC/185 - FANUC's latest in its industry leading line of palletizing robots - includes a 185 kg payload, 3,140 mm reach, and is capable of performing 1,700 standard palletizing cycles/hour, making it the fastest palletizing robot in its class. PASCO designed a mechanical two-pick end of arm tool for the system. Both lines can run independently of each other, using different pallet sizes and patters. Everything seen here was engineered, manufactured and tested at PASCO headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.

The client's staff had to perform this repetitive and monotonous task while maintaining full concentration - there is 0% margin for error but many points in the process for error to occur. Worse still, these errors are very easily overlooked. The valve body is the control centre of the transmission. It uses a system of hydraulic fluid directed over a baffle plate via a layered network of pathways, valves, check balls and servo pistons. This layered network is sandwiched with gaskets before being screwed together. During assembly, the operator is required to position a total of up to 6 springs and 7 check-balls of varying size at points in the maze-like pathways on each layer of the valve body. If just one of these is incorrectly placed, the final transmission unit will fail during testing and need to be disassembled - a wasteful and time-consuming exercise that cannot be afforded, particularly under the ""lean manufacturing"" methodology commonly required by the large automotive companies. Operators would also need to check that all other pathways were clear, that the springs operated freely and that each part was free of metal casting burrs. Working up to three shifts per day, six operators could be called upon to perform this repetitive yet exacting assembly procedure, with all the inherent potential for errors and repetitive strain injury. The Solution Equipment: * Motoman HP50 robot and NX100 controller * RA designed end-of-arm tooling with multiple dispensers/magazines, pneumatic grippers and automatic tool-change interface * RA designed lightbox/camera unit. Image recognition software * RA designed jigging with screw driving system * RA designed twin-station work cell with safety features: automatic screens, interlocks etc With this twin station solution, a single operator outside the cell can load the gaskets and baffle plates on one station while, inside the cell, the robot is completing assembly at the other station. The operator and robot then swap stations, with the operator removing a finished unit before loading new parts again. Production is continuous. Beginning the automated process, the cell's integrated vision system checks the position of the loaded parts and identifies any burrs, blockages or deformations formed during the casting of the metal parts. The Motoman HP50 robot now begins positioning springs and three sizes/colours of check-balls from its on-board magazines/dispensers into precise points on 2 baffle plates. The robot then retreats for a second to allow the vision system to confirm the balls & springs have all remained in place and no other material is blocking the pathways. The robot next checks that all 6 springs are performing freely to the correct specification by use of a position transducer on the gripper. The robot's grippers are then used to position gaskets on the baffle plate which will create a watertight seal to withstand the pressurised hydraulic fluid when the unit is finally installed. Lastly, the robot engages its tool-change interface to connect to the jig holding the top layer baffle plate. The robot lifts this whole jig, with set of plate,check-balls and gaskets in situ, before flipping and positioning atop the first set and then engaging the jig's on-board screw drivers to lock the unit into final assembly. The finished unit is then ready to be unloaded while the robot immediately starts assembly of the next unit. Benefits: * Minimised failure rate in the final unit * labour saved in disassembly and reassembly after failure * Increased staff safety and reduced repetitive strain injuries/claims * shorter assembly time on each valve body * greater productivity * saved labour & associated costs x 4 * Less break time and down time in production * Increased reliability & continuity of ""lean"" production Robotic Automation P/L is the LARGEST Australian supplier of turnkey automation systems.

Shah : Integrating Robots into Team-Oriented Environments"	"youtube.com"	"Julie A. Shah Assistant Professor, MIT February 21, 2014 Abstract Recent advances in computation, sensing, and hardware enable robotics to perform an increasing percentage of traditionally manual tasks in manufacturing. Yet, often the assembly mechanic cannot be removed entirely from the process. This provides new economic motivation to explore opportunities where assembly mechanics and industrial robots may work in close physical collaboration. In this talk, I present adaptive work-sharing and scheduling algorithms to collaborate with industrial robots on two levels: one-to-one human robot teamwork, and factory-level sequencing and scheduling of human and robotic tasks. I discuss our recent work developing adaptive control methods that incorporate high-level, person-specific planning and execution mechanisms to promote predictable, convergent team behavior. We apply human factors modeling coupled with statistical methods for planning and control to derive quantitative methods for assessing the quality and convergence of learnt teaming models, and to perform risk-sensitive robot control on the production line. I also discuss computationally efficient methods for coordinating human and robotic sequencing and scheduling at the factory-level. Tight integration of human workers and robotic resources involves complex dependencies. Even relatively small increases in process time variability lead to schedule inefficiencies and performance degradation. Our methods allow fast, dynamic computation of robot tasking and scheduling to respond to people working and coordinating in shared physical space, and provide real-time guarantees that schedule deadlines and other operational constraints will be met. Speaker Biography Julie Shah is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics and leads the Interactive Robotics Group of the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Shah received her SB (2004) and SM (2006)from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT, and her PhD (2010) in Autonomous Systems from MIT. Before joining the faculty, she worked at Boeing Research and Technology on robotics applications for aerospace manufacturing. She has developed innovative methods for enabling fluid human-robot teamwork in time-critical, safety-critical domains, ranging from manufacturing to surgery to space exploration. Her group draws on expertise in artificial intelligence, human factors, and systems engineering to develop interactive robots that emulate the qualities of effective human team members to improve the efficiency of human-robot teamwork. This work was recognized by the Technology Review as one of the 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2013, and has received international recognition in the form of best paper awards and nominations from the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, and the International Symposium on Robotics."

A major challenge in developing the system was to be able to identify the nine different wheel types being loaded into the system from the nine separate die cast machines. The original process was extremely repetitive, labor intensive and exhausting. 15 total manual finishers were used for the process. Acme was able to successfully automate the process through the use of two FANUC R-2000iB/210F robots for gate removal, and four FANUC M-710iC robots for milling and deburring. Additionally, six FANUC iRVision cameras are used in the system of part identification and process alignment. The system starts as the aluminum motorcycle wheels are randomly presented into the system. FANUC iRVision identifies the parts and key process variables are carried out for all operations. A FANUC R-2000iB/210F picks a wheel and manipulates it through an Acme designed cut-off saw for gate and sprue removal. This includes carbide saw performance monitoring. Upon completion, the robot feeds the wheel to the two FANUC M-710iC milling and deburring robots. These robots grab the wheels and present them to an iRvision system used for unique tool frames since each part has a different casting variation. The robot moves the wheel to a fixed mill, which removes flash and qualifies the surface finish for compliant deburring operation. Laser tool monitoring is used for quality control. Finally, the finished wheels are conveyed out of the system. This robotic system from Acme Manufacturing produces one finished wheel every 34 seconds.

It wasn't quite as straight forward as just a print as the board is longer than our build tray, meaning that we had to cut it into 3 sections, joining it together with some connector pins to ensure accuracy and to give it some strength over a simple butt joint. The final result... the worlds first 3d printed twin tip skateboard. ...is it ride-able? Yes... but I wouldn't drop down many sets of stairs on it just yet!

Amature GunSmith Makes an AR-15 Rifle"	"youtube.com"	"Please SUBSCRIBE: http://www.youtube.com/LUXETTI Make a Working GUN using a 3D Printer! 100% Legal. Amature GunSmith Makes an AR-15 Rifle From pediatric prosthetics to drugs and guitars, 3-D printing is already revolutionizing the way we use, make and think about a plethora of products. Now, a firearms enthusiast is claiming to have added yet another thing to the list: a functional AR-15 rifle, which he made at home using a 3-D printer and gun blueprints downloaded from the Internet. Last month, Extreme Tech reported that amateur gunsmith Michael Guslick had managed to ""construct and shoot a pistol partly made out of plastic, 3-D printed parts."" Guslick, an engineer who operates under the moniker 'HaveBlue,' had previously announced in an online forum that he had successfully fired 200 rounds from his custom-made, 3-D printed .22 caliber pistol. The pistol was partially made out of plastic, having been created from a 3-D printed lower receiver and a commercial upper receiver. In other words, the main body of the gun was made of plastic and printed at home. Guslick told The Huffington Post that he had obtained gun blueprints from a website before using his 3-D printer to print the component. To complete the weapon, he then combined it with off-the-shelf metal parts. Guslick said that the resulting gun was a success. ""Everything ran just as it should, magazine after magazine,"" Guslick described in a blog post. ""To be honest, it was acting more reliably than a number of other .22 pistols I've shot."" The 3-D printed AR-15 lower receiver and an earlier 75 percent scale version, which Guslick said he printed as an initial feasibility test Guslick said he then adapted what he had created to make an AR-15 -- a semiautomatic rifle. Guslick said that creating his own rifle -- which incidentally was the same model used by alleged Aurora gunman James Holmes -- ""wasn't that difficult."" The 3-D printed lower receiver assembled into a functioning .22 caliber pistol However, Guslick said that though early testing of the rifle proved that it worked, it still had some minor feed and extraction problems that needed to be sorted out, Popsci notes. Though various news sources have reported that the gun enthusiast's homemade weapon is the ""world's first 3-D printed gun,"" Guslick was quick to point out that this is not the case. ""Firearms manufacturers have been doing exactly that for prototyping and testing for many years, and I'm certain many hobbyists have used 3-D printed gun parts as well,"" he told HuffPost. However, he added that his gun is -- to the best of his knowledge -- the ""first 3-D printed firearm to actually be tested"" in a non-commercial setting. News of Guslick's creation has provoked a number of discussions about gun control laws and the future of gun use and manufacturing in this country and elsewhere -- with some commenters saying that 3-D printers could now allow just about anyone to assemble a completed gun from mail-order parts without government licensing or registration. Others have pointed out that Guslick only used a 3-D printer to create one component of the rifle and that an all-plastic, functioning assault weapon is probably not in our near future. For his part, Guslick said he's been surprised by all the media attention and insists that the creation of a 3-D printed firearm is not cause for alarm. ""In the end, 3-D printing an AR-15 lower receiver and assembling it into a functional gun is unremarkable on a technical level, yet a curious novelty on a legal level,"" he said. ""[And] yes, though such tools are equally available to criminals as well, I cannot foresee criminals turning to 3-D printing as an avenue to obtain illicit arms when the black market continues to serve as a far simpler means of acquisition -- and does not require any level of technical acumen."" Ultimately, Guslick said he hopes his 3-D printed creation does not take away from the many possibilities that 3-D printing has for our future. ""3-D printing will change our perception of mass production, with products being made more economically, not to mention locally. Similarly, 3-D printing will expand to help redefine ergonomics as more of the items we use everyday will not just be designed for 'humans' but for 'individuals,'"" he said. tags: 2012 news 3d printer technology advanced concern deadly weapon gunsmith ar15 firearm round pistol gun parts regulation law easy craft custom made unique afordable dollar design cad computer graphics plastic make rifle laws america u.s. usa police consumer software digital copyright trend trends trendy russia today rt dream object prototype blueprint model 829speedy luxetti"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YqzJlBcCsow/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/YqzJlBcCsow"	"5775844451ac8413da8a491e"	"What If 3D Printing Was 100x Faster? | Joseph DeSimone | TED Talks"	"youtube.com"	"What we think of as 3D printing, says Joseph DeSimone, is really just 2D printing over and over ... slowly.

This part of the chest is notoriously tricky to recreate with prosthetics, due to the complex geometry and design required for each patient.

These methods can be used for the production of objects made from a single type of material as well as combinations of materials in which each material is deposited, for instance, by a separate print head. An example of a 3D printing system with several print heads is the PrintValley machine recently developed by TNO. This kind of technology will lead to new types of production systems for the manufacture of complex multi-material products. Applications for this can be found among a whole range of sectors like electronics, solar cells, lighting and food. By combining and merging all the many different disciplines it has at its disposal, TNO can offer uniquely innovative, sustainable solutions such as food printing that make use of this multidisciplinary approach, combining knowledge of mechatronics, 3D industrial printing and specific food knowledge in the areas of ingredients, formulae, texture and structure."

In 3D printing, successive layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. These objects can be of almost any shape or geometry, and are produced from a 3D model or other electronic data source. A 3D printer is a type of industrial robot. Futurologists such as Jeremy Rifkin believe that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution, succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century. Using the power of the Internet, it may eventually be possible to send a blueprint of any product to any place in the world to be replicated by a 3D printer with ""elemental inks"" capable of being combined into any material substance of any desired form. 3D printing in the term's original sense refers to processes that sequentially deposit material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads. More recently, the meaning of the term has expanded to encompass a wider variety of techniques such as extrusion and sintering-based processes. Technical standards generally use the term additive manufacturing for this broader sense. Cheap 3D Printer. These videos are taken from Creative Tools's Vimeo channel.

Smaller unmanned aircraft -- or UAVs -- are created by super high-tech on-board 3D printers, via Additive Layer Manufacturing and robotic assembly techniques. The 3D printers respond to data fed to them by a remote control room where a human commander decides what should be produced. The UAVs are best suited to each scenario -- be it a group of wide-winged aircraft for protracted or enduring surveillance -- or rotary-winged UAVs to rescue single civilians or soldiers from dangerous situations. After use the UAVs could render themselves useless through dissolving circuit boards or they might safely land in a recoverable position if re-use was required. This creates the ultimate adaptable taskforce, with a lead aircraft able to enter any unknown scenario and quickly manufacture an effective toolset for any task."

How would you like to download a coffee table? Or at least a digital model of a coffee table that you could customize any way you like so it fit perfectly in your living room and then you just print it out. I'm not talking about a picture of a coffee table. I'm talking about an actual, physical three-dimensional object that lives in your living room. Well it's all possible. It's the world of 3D printing and it's going to change everything. It'll redefine the way we think about innovation, design, manufacturing, distribution. Everything about buying and selling tangible goods from here to Mars. Simply put, 3D printing is the process of making three-dimensional, solid objects out of 1's and 0's from a digital file. 3D printers bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds. It uses very thin layers of plastic, measuring just a few microns, as thin as a sheet of copy paper, to build an object from the bottom up. This is additive manufacturing. It creates a new item by adding only what is needed. Unlike other forms of manufacturing where the excess is carved, cut or melted away, leaving a ton of waste. And 3D printing isn't limited to plastics. Already, you can print stuff to glass, metal, food, organs - I'm not talking about the musical instrument, I'm talking about human tissue. I kid you not! A couple of years ago there was a guy who demonstrated he could print human kidneys using living cells as ink. We're talking about the ability to create transplant organs with a 3D printer. And this isn't the future we're talking about - we're talking about right now! I mean we've come a long way from the 1980s when a bunch of do-it-yourself nuts decided to kickstart 3D printing. Today, you and I, you know, people who have real jobs, we can actually go out and buy one of these things for like, a thousand bucks. Forbes estimates that it'll be a five billion dollar industry by the year 2020. And as these printers become more popular, the price comes down, which means consumers like me and you can afford to buy one ourselves. Or have a friend print one out for us. Once we get to the point where we can print circuitry directly, you print one printer that prints another printer, and it's game over. We're talking limitless customization. You could even scan your entire body and print out your own action figure. Or in my case, an inaction figure. NASA's using 3D printers to make repairs on space equipment. They use a process called selective laser melting, or SLM, that they use to create a nickel alloy to repair everything like the J2 rocket engine. I mean, this is the promise of 3D printing! We can make our lives as customized as we want, print any object you can imagine, and have it in your hand in just a matter of hours. And in the immediate future, it could mean that astronauts are able to print our repair parts for space craft or space stations, which are pretty important when you're months away from a rescue mission. I mean, imagine what it would've been like if Apollo 13 had a 3D printer on board. But then we wouldn't have had Tom Hanks in space..."

The Wall Street Journal recently took a look at how three major U.S. manufacturers -- Ford, GE and Mattel -- are using 3D printing to cut costs and production times during the prototyping phase. Ford uses the technology to print cylinder heads, brake rotors and rear axels for test vehicles. Thanks to 3D printing, production time for one type of cylinder head, used in its fuel-efficient EcoBoost engines, is cut down from four to five months to three, shaving 25% to 40% off production time. Earlier casting methods required that the mold be cut from sand; 3D printing allows Ford to skip the cutting process and pour the metal directly into the molds. GE, meanwhile, says that 3D printing is helping the company cut production costs of certain parts, including an ultrasound probe, by up to 30%. In the future, Ford believes its customers will be able to print replacement parts for their vehicles at a local 3D printer in a matter of hours or even minutes. Mattel, for its part, has no such plans to allow customers to print their own Barbie dolls or other toys, citing child safety concerns.

(Some of these parts were created using a variety of 3D printing technologies including Stratasys Objet 3D printers.) In this insightful interview, Neri Oxman,architect, designer and professor of Media Arts and Sciences and Director of the Mediated Matter group at the MIT Media Lab, explains the differences between 'additive' and 'subtractive' manufacturing. Inspired by things that 'grow' in nature, Oxman uses the world's most advanced 3D printing technology - the Stratasys Objet Connex500 multi-material 3D printer to produce some incredible models which were on display at the Pompidou Center until August 6th 2012 at the 'Multiversites Creatives' exhibit. Neri also explains 3D printing within the wider paradigm shift in technology and manufacturing - comparing it to the Gutenberg 2D print revolution of the 1440's."

See how PolyJet 3D Printing technology from Stratasys helps a team at Budapest University create an injection mold for functional testing at reduced time and cost. Commissioned to produce a fan that provides enhanced engine cooling and reduced noise, Dr. Jozsef Gabor Kovacs, Department of Polymer Engineering, Budapest University of Technology and Economics (http://www.pt.bme.hu/index.php?l=a), and his team needed to find an efficient, inexpensive method of producing injection molded prototypes to test the fan in the end-product material. The design and development process involved subjecting the fan to extreme functional tests on a tight deadline, so the team had to produce iterations extremely quickly. Conventional methods of producing molds, such as CNC manufacturing with steel, are expensive and time-consuming. So Kovacs took the innovative approach of using the PolyJet-based Objet Connex 3D printer to produce the injection molds. See the complete production process in just over 90 seconds!"

Then 3D print the idea using an Objet multi-material 3D Printer which produces all moving parts and different color/material properties in a single production step. A few short hours later you hold a finished, ready-assembled product or prototype. Feel it, test it to validate that your concept really works.

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing[1] is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes. LEARN HOW TO GET YOUR FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENCE CLICK HERE http://13e4933lo3ir8kba07mdg-6ixz.hop.clickbank.net/ [2] 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes). A materials printer usually performs 3D printing using digital technology. The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp.[3] Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines, and their price has dropped substantially.[4] According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.[5] The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, engineering, civil engineering, dental and medical industries, biotech (human tissue replacement), fashion, footwear, jewelry, eyewear, education, geographic information systems, food, and many other fields. It has been speculated[6] that 3D printing may become a mass market item because open source 3D printing can easily offset their capital costs by enabling consumers to avoid costs associated with purchasing common household objects.[7] The concept of 3D printing really began to be taken seriously in the 1980s.[8] The man most often credited[citation needed] with inventing the language of 'modern' 3D printer is Charles W. Hull, who used the term stereolithography--defined as a ""system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed""--in a 1984 patent.[9][10] The term additive manufacturing refers to technologies that create objects through sequential layering.[citation needed] Objects that are manufactured additively can be used anywhere throughout the product life cycle, from pre-production (i.e. rapid prototyping) to full-scale production (i.e. rapid manufacturing), in addition to tooling applications and post-production customization. In manufacturing, and machining in particular, subtractive methods refers to more traditional methods. The term subtractive manufacturing is a retronym developed in recent years[citation needed] to distinguish it from newer additive manufacturing techniques. Although fabrication has included methods that are essentially ""additive"" for centuries (such as joining plates, sheets, forgings, and rolled work via riveting, screwing, forge welding, or newer kinds of welding), it did not include the information technology component of model-based definition. Machining (generating exact shapes with high precision) has typically been subtractive, from filing and turning to milling, drilling and grinding. To perform a print, the machine reads the design from an .stl file and lays down successive layers of liquid, powder, paper or sheet material to build the model from a series of cross sections. These layers, which correspond to the virtual cross sections from the CAD model, are joined or automatically fused to create the final shape. The primary advantage of this technique is its ability to create almost any shape or geometric feature. Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X-Y resolution in dpi (dots per inch),[citation needed] or micrometers. Typical layer thickness is around 100 micrometers (um), although some machines such as the Objet Connex series and 3D Systems' ProJet series can print layers as thin as 16 um.[11] X-Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles (3D dots) are around 50 to 100 um in diameter. Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours, although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously. Traditional techniques like injection molding can be less expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities, but additive manufacturing can be faster, more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts. 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer. Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications,"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z223PiTydTo/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/Z223PiTydTo"	"5775844651ac8413da8a4946"	"Rapid Prototyping with FDM and PolyJet-based Stratasys 3D Printers at Hyphen"	"youtube.com"	"""Build.

Nano Tech Injection Lobotomy"	"youtube.com"	"THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING!!! LINKS ARE BELOW The establishment media and the scientific dictatorship are promoting brain-eating vaccines that virtually lobotomize people and rewire their brains into a state of subservient compliance so that their natural instinct to get angry and rebel against the tyranny being imposed upon them is neutered and sterilized. ""Academics say they are close to developing the first vaccine for stress -- a single jab that would help us relax without slowing down,"" reports the Daily Mail.

"youtube.com"	"Dr. Kaku addresses the question of the possibility of utopia, the perfect society that people have tried to create throughout history. These dreams have not been realized because we have scarcity. However, now we have nanotechnology, and with nanotechnology, perhaps, says Dr. Michio Kaku, maybe in 100 years, we'll have something called the replicator, which will create enormous abundance. Transcript-- Throughout human history people have tried to create utopia, the perfect society.  In fact, America, the American dream, in some sense was based on utopianism.  Why do we have the Shaker movement?  Why did we have the Quakers?  Why did we have so many different kinds of religious movements that fled Europe looking to create autopia here in the Americas?  Well, we know the Shakers have disappeared and many of these colonies have also disappeared only to be found in footnotes in American textbooks, and the question is why? One reason why is scarcity because back then the industrial revolution was still young and societies had scarcity.  Scarcity creates conflict and unless you have a way to resolve conflict, your colony falls apart.  How do you allocate resources?  Who gets access to food when there is a famine?  Who gets shelter when there is a snowstorm and all of the sudden you've eaten up your seed corn?  These are questions that faced the early American colonists, and that's the reason why we only see the ghost towns of these utopias. However, now we have nanotechnology, and with nanotechnology, perhaps, who knows, maybe in 100 years, we'll have something called the replicator.  Now the replicator is something you see in Star Trek.  It's called the molecular assembler and it takes ordinary raw materials, breaks them up at the atomic level and joins the joints in different ways to create new substances.  If you have a molecular assembler, you can turn, for example, a glass into wood or vice versa.  You would have the power of a magician, in fact, the power of a god, the ability to literally transform the atoms of one substance into another and we see it on Star Trek. It's also the most subversive device of all because if utopias fail because of scarcity then what happens when you have infinite abundance?  What happens when you simply ask and it comes to you?  One of my favorite episodes on Star Trek is when the Enterprise encounters a space capsule left over from the 20th century, the bad 20th century.  People died of all these horrible diseases, and many people froze themselves knowing that in the 23rd century or so they'll be thawed out and their diseases will be cured.  Well, sure enough, it's the 23rd century now.  The Enterprise finds a space capsule and begins to revive all these people and cure them of cancer, cure them of incurable genetic diseases, and then one of these individuals, however, was a banker.  He is revived and he says to himself, ""My God, my gamble worked; I'm alive; I'm in the 23rd century,"" and he said, ""Call my stock broker; call my banker; I am rich; I am rich; my investments, they have been sitting there in the bank for centuries; I must be a quadrillionaire!""  And then the crew of the Enterprise looks at this man and says, ""What is money; what is a bank; what is a stock broker?  We don't have any of these in the 23rd century,"" and then they say, ""If you want something, you simply ask for it and you get it."" Now that's subversive.  That's revolutionary because if all utopiansocieties vanished because of scarcity and conflict, what happens when there is no scarcity?  What happens when you simply ask and you get what you want?  This has enormous philosophical implications.  For example, why bother to work?  Why bother to go to work when you simply ask for things and it comes to you? ...

Generally nanotechnology deals with structures 100 nanometers or smaller, and involves developing materials or devices within that size. Nanotechnology is an extremely diverse and multidisciplinary field, ranging from novel extensions of conventional device physics, to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, to developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale, or the scale of nothing, even to speculation on whether we can directly control matter on the atomic scale. There has been much debate on the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology has the potential to create many new materials and devices with wide-ranging applications, such as in medicine, electronics, and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as with any introduction of new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have lead to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted."

Is this really true? The fact is 9 out of 10 cars (brand new cars) which come to our workshop for our Ceramic Polymer Nanotechnology paint protection already have some damage to the paint caused by incorrect washing or buffing technique from detailers in car dealerships. Some cars have arrived with the conservation factory wax still present on them. If the car dealers can't prepare your brand new vehicle for the delivery, would you trust their paint protection to be long lasting? Very easy to apply, no hard rubbing or buffing! Ceramic Polymer Sealant is an unique and innovative blend of ceramic and anti-static polymer chemistry. It is also the most feasible and extensive way to achieve long-term benefit from our proprietary car care coating chemistry. Extremely easy to use, Ceramic Polymer Sealant is simply wiped on the cleaned and polished paint surface, allowed to dry and then wiped clear. The result is a semi-permanent glossy ceramic membrane of grime repelling protection. In addition to the paint surface, glass and metal finishes are enhanced, protected and made much easier to clean. The cost savings in the reduction of next-time-cleaning is measurable. Often only a wipe from a moisten microfiber cloth is necessary. Eco-friendly, and 98% VOC (volatile organic compounds) free. Three (3) year guarantee of added paint gloss and protection in a single application. Guaranty is extended to five (5) years when applied in conjunction with HyperPolish or NanoGloss. Our workshop is located half way between Brisbane and Gold Coast, about 15 minutes drive from Springwood or 15 minutes drive from Oxenford. http://www.carcarecoatings.com.au/products.asp?cat=DIY+Paint+Protection+Kits"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tWBRvepCDUU/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/tWBRvepCDUU"	"577586d651ac8414282a3afc"	"NANOTECHNOLOGY 2013: Google Nanobots to Borg Humans"	"youtube.com"	"In today's video, Christopher Greene of AMTV explains Google Nanobots will borg humans so they can live forever.

We are going to clearly define the goals of the negative exterrestrials. We are then going to discuss something that threatens our very humanity, and that is something called transhumanism. What is transhumanism, and why is it threatening our humanity? Along the way, we will touch on the subject of the Fourth Reich in America. Finally, I am going to give you your first mantra, designed to begin the process of activating you. We are going to discuss a program called the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) as a modified ""Voice of God"" weapon, to make Iraqi soldiers think they were hearing the voice of God. And there's the nagging question of classified microwave work at Brooks Air Force Base that the Air force stubbornly refuses to talk about)."" You will learn about GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) toxins! One of the ways the people in power are trying to destroy us. We did not defeat the Nazis. They swapped all their technologies for pardon, entrance and immunity to the United States. Majestic 12, National Security Council, sonic frequencies, scalar waves, exotic energies, the Western Mystery Tradition, all will be discussed in tonight's program If one were to travel through the deserts of Central Asia he would observe how many cities, once great and prosperous like Paris and London, are now demolished and razed to the ground. From the Caspian Sea to the River Oxus there stretch wild and desolate plains, deserts, wildernesses and valleys. For two days and two nights the Russian railway traverseth the ruined cities and uninhabited villages of that wasteland. Formerly that plain bore the fruit of the finest civilizations of the past. Tokens of development and refinement were apparent all around, arts and sciences were well protected and promoted, professions and industries flourished, commerce and agriculture had reached a high stage of efficiency, and the foundations of government and statesmanship were laid on a strong and solid basis. Today that vast stretch of land hath become mostly the shelter and asylum of Turkoman tribes, and an arena for the display of wild beasts. The ancient cities of that plain, such as Gurgan, Nissa, Abyord and Shahristan, famous throughout the world for their arts, sciences, culture, industry, and well known for their wealth, greatness, prosperity and distinction, have given way to a wilderness wherein no voice is heard save the roaring of wild beasts and where bloodthirsty wolves roam at will.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

Really good ideas and strokes of genius are often manifest in the right questions being asked: How small can information be encoded? How can information be written? How can information it be read? All of these important ""Hows"" were asked by Feynman in a time when computers had to be put in large rooms and when the impending space race was forcing engineers to do some serious strategic thinking in making technology small enough to be lifted by rockets into space to function as serious tools in scientific exploration and defence. Feynman himself may not have invented the technology we see in the development and continuity of the computer age, but the fact that even in the early 1960's nanotechnology was being considered as a serious field of study was definitely a factor contributing to the boom in computer technology seen in the late 20th century and continues to reach more spectacular levels of sophistication in the 21st century. Jump 25 years forward into the year 1984, when Feynman tries to retell his 1959 lecture from a more modern perspective in that many aspects of his vision have been fulfilled, particularly with the invention of the electron microscope, the atomic force microscope and experimental manipulation of the atomic scale of matter. Also discussed is the current practical field of photolithography for the manufacture of bipolar transistors and junctions used in computer chips done on an industrial scale and how this process continues with ever decreasing wavelength capabilities of lasers from UV to X-rays. Feynman also discusses the boundaries of miniaturization and how the scale differences affect the function of certain aspects of technology as well as in nature. In the true spirit of Feynman, the discussion goes into the colorful details and gives diagrammatic examples of how this field had progressed from 1959 to 1984. We can only imagine how Feynman would have felt about the modern developments in nanotechnology in the 21st century where entirely exotic principles of physics may begin to become technologically significant, including vacuum fluctuations and quantum entanglements. Without a doubt he would have found our developments exciting but always within the realms of understanding by studying the most fundamental language of nature, quantum mechanics, to bring our macroscopic brains into visualizing, however abstractly, the tiny machinery of nature."

The study of, and the ability to control, those atoms and molecules is through the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The scale of things on the nano scale are smaller than the width of a human hair.Nanotechnology has been used in various fields such as computer science and engineering, physics, chemistry and biology.Flexible electronics and wearable electronics are among the many growing fields that owe their existence to nanotechnology.  Graphene is a nano material that is a conductive sheet of very thin, but very strong carbon.  It is transparent, but is also very lightweight. Graphene is one of the most promising nano materials available to scientists today.The second portion of this video covers Quantum Computing.  A quantum computer is an extremely fast computer.   The processing power of a quantum computer is far greater than that of classical computers.  Computers read information that are coded in bits, which are represented by 0's and 1's.  A classical computer can process only one bit at a time, either a 0 or a 1.  A Quantum computer, has quantum bits, or qbits, and a qbit can be a 0 and 1 at the same time. The next portion of the video covers cyborg anthropology and the evaporation of the interface.  If you use a cell phone or manipulate a computer or tablet, you would be considered a low tech cyborg.  A cyborg is an organism that has had certain outside components added to it in order for that organism to be able to fit in to its environment. The next step in the evolution of humans as cyborgs would be the evaporation of the interface.  Soon it will be possible to do away with our need to interface with technology, because the technology will be able to sense our needs and react accordingly, without the need to push a button, or manipulate the device in any way. Similarly to the way that primitive tools enhanced humans ability to hunt, and an automobile enhanced our ability to move and travel faster without wasting our energy, the microprocessor is enhancing human cognitive capacity.Science Documentary: Cognitive Sciencehttp://youtu.be/0T_nOzpBYxUScience Documentary: Planet Formationhttp://youtu.be/yQexV341t-EScience Documentary: Expansion of the Universehttp://youtu.be/nxsOVYmwSOkScience Documentary: Star Formationhttp://youtu.be/VJ9fmAGShvsScience Documentary: Cosmic Microwave Backgroundhttp://youtu.be/fSPQbrxD75wScience Documentary: Electromagnetic Spectrumhttp://youtu.be/41Q6FeO-_8IGoogle+https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/1023842...

Nanotech is manipulation of matter on an atomic. Meaning, its a building block technology for building one atom at a time, as if building with legos. This is particularly apparent when tiny robots are built. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. Because of the variety of potential applications, partially in medicine, and the military applications tend to be scary, governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research.

Miniaturization is, perhaps ironically, a huge deal. I mean, without it we wouldn't have had the personal computer revolution and we wouldn't have this world we live in now where we have smartphones and tablets and other devices just as powerful as a computer, that can fit in the palm of your hand. But even these gadgets are gargantuan compared to nanotechnology. See, a nanometer is just one billionth of a meter, and that's kind of hard to imagine, so let me put it to you this way. Your typical sheet of paper is about one hundred thousand nanometers thick. And at this scale, individual elements are so small you can't even see them with a light microscope. Now as we learn more about how materials behave on the nanoscale, we have more potential applications to use that knowledge practically. I'm talking about how nanotech could help solar panel technology. And fortunately, at a recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, or AAAS, they had a panel on just this very subject. Now, if you know anything about solar panels you know they have some drawbacks. For example, efficiency - they max out at around twenty percent in the field under ideal conditions. They're also rigid, so you can't just put them anywhere you like. And they tend to be expensive because manufacturing them is complicated. But scientists hope that nanotechnology can help address all three of these challenges. Now with efficiency they're looking to nature - specifically, moth eyes. You see, moths have these little tiny structures in their eyes that help reflect light back into the eye and it does two things - it lets them see better in the dark, and it cuts down on reflection so predators can't spot them as easily. With solar panels it could actually make them more efficient by reflecting more of the sun's light into the panel so you lose less in reflection. And when we're talking about flexibility, well nanomaterials are really, really small, and there is the potential to create solar panels that are just a few sheets of molecules thick. They could be as flexible as a sheet of paper, and with that kind of flexibility you could put those pretty much anywhere you wanted to. And as for price, well, that's the big one. And in the short term I don't think it's going to turn around. But scientists are cautiously optimistic that nanotechnology will let us use new processes, like printing solar panels directly onto a substrate using just a specialized printer. That would actually be less complicated and expensive than traditional manufacturing methods. Now at that meeting of the AAAS, a Dr. Wolfgang Porod gave a talk about Nanoantenna Thermocouples for Energy Harvesting. Which I admit sounds like techno-babble straight out of a Star Trek episode. But it's actually fairly simple once you break it down. A nanoantenna is just an antenna on the nanoscale. These resonate with long-wave infrared radiation. And a thermocouple? Well that's a component of circuitry that generates a voltage when one part of the thermocouple is a different temperature than other part. So you pair these two together and the antenna generates heat and the thermocouple generates voltage. It could actually help increase the efficiency of solar panels. Now like I said, nanotechnology is a young science and it has lots of different applications across many disciplines. And I'm really excited how such a small technology could have such a huge impact."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AnMsyIT26A/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/5AnMsyIT26A"

I also again like in the Unboxing, Review, Maiden video, I flew it stock with the ""toy transmitter"" that comes with the Hobbyzone Champ during the flight seen in this video. Horizon Hobby describes it as the follow: ""The tiny Nano QX is RC flying fun you can take with you everywhere. The Nano QX weighs little more than half an ounce and is small enough to fly in spaces no bigger than an office cubicle. Never flown a quad-copter before? No problem. The Blade Nano QX uses the SAFE(tm) technology system with sophisticated flight control software to keep itself stable in a hover while in stability mode. If you get in trouble, just let go of the sticks. The SAFE technology system will bring the Nano QX back to a hover all by itself. Once you've mastered the basics, you can switch the SAFE system to agility mode for faster flying speeds and more maneuverability. SAFE stands for Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope and is central to the performance of the Nano QX. Even new pilots will feel comfortable with the Nano QX in stability mode because SAFE will make sure the quad is always in control and in an upright fashion. You will feel an immediate sense of confidence and be flying around like a pro in no time!"" I would like to some it up like this: Like AS3X Technology, the SAFE Technology is a work in progress. Once it gets a little more polish and tuned a bit better, both will be amazing. There are still a few bugs to be worked out, however. GB PS: This is a bit to small to try RC helicopter fishing, RC quadcopter fishing or RC quad-copter fishing. The QX Nano is fun and hard to pass up at this price. Once you get good with it, it will be easy to perform stunts, tricks, and other acrobatic moves without crashing. Also, it is called a Blade Nano QX, not a Blade XQ Nano or Blade Nano XQ."

Watch it with maximum quality in YouTube App (updated) on iOS or Android, or Chrome on a computer. Move your phone around you to be able to look in any direction and find the hidden objects. I was making another 3D animation about Star Wars and I stopped after I saw this 360o videos. It's really great that you can be able to look around the space. So I came with this idea, a First Person Mouse Droid, another way to see the Hangar of an Imperial Star Destroyer and how Darth Vader walk with hundreds of Stormtroopers... and Boba Fett, of course. What do you guys think about this 360o videos? If you enjoy this, visit our Patreon page and consider supporting more videos: http://patreon.com/PipocaVFX --- (PORT) Veja Star Wars em 360o.

Mova o celular/tablet para poder ver em qualquer direcao e achar os objetos escondidos. Eu estava fazendo uma outra animacao em 3D sobre Star Wars e parei porque vi esses videos em 360o. E realmente legal voce ter essa liberdade de olhar a qualquer direcao. Entao eu tive a ideia de fazer um video desde o ponto de vista do Mouse Droid, uma outra forma de ver e estar no hangar de um Imperial Star Destroyer passando ao lado de Darth Vader com centos  de Stormtroopers olhando... e Boba Fett, claro.
