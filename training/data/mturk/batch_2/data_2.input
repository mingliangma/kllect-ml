Energy Seminar - March 31, 2014 Formation and aging costs, coupled with limitations in construction due to lamination, physical limits of transport and mechanics and limited ability to integrate new materials into the existing manufacturing approach, will severely limit gains in performance and safety in this generation of technology. The incumbent technology further requires massive downstream costs to assure the safety of these liquid-based systems, in the form of safety and containment systems. Examination of a mapping of the available materials against their probable effect on cell properties yields a simple conclusion: the incumbent technology benefits have essentially reached their limit, as established holistically by laboratory developments, optimization simulations, and recent commercially reported properties. Solid state battery technology, though offering a very different development path enabling breakthrough performance and safety, has been relegated to the realm of R&D due to intrinsically high cost, unscalable manufacturing processes that result in high cell cost. Recently, however, Sakti3, a university spinout founded by researchers and engineers with decades of experience in battery research and thin film and other manufacturing, developed an approach for production of cells which offers all of the benefits of the theoretically highest energy density materials available. These massively replicable, cheap and reliable production methods enable cell manufacturing in a single, unified line and produce product that is ready to ship. Integration of new, environmentally benign energy generation technologies will require improved energy storage both for regulation of load, and for storage of solar and wind power. Non emissive automobiles and use of existing electrical power grids to power them, require safe, onboard traction storage systems. And finally, the democratization of information and the use of mobile devices as the primary, and often the only, connectivity to the internet and commerce, requires safe, high energy density storage technology be available to the consumer. We discuss our vision for technology deployment and future product development using solid state processing of energy storage technology and integration into existing and new infrastructures. Ann Marie Sastry brings over 25 years' leadership and technical experience to her role at Sakti3, building a management team with experience in finance, manufacturing and technology. She personally trained the core technical team. Sastry has co-authored over 70 awarded and filed patents, over 100 scientific publications, and delivered over 100 invited lectures at research, government and private institutions globally. Prior to leading Sakti3, Sastry was the Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Engineering at the University of Michigan. Tenured and promoted early, she founded and led two research centers in batteries and bioscience, and a global graduate program. Her laboratory originated the technical work that underpins Sakti3 technology, and was continuously funded by the DOE for over 17 years. She also led work sponsored by NSF, NIH, Army, ONR, DARPA, General Motors, Ford, LBNL, and ORNL. She has received several of the highest technical honors in her field, including the 2011 ASME Frank Kreith Energy Award, 2007 ASME Gustus Larson Award and the NSF's PECASE (1997). She holds Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Cornell University, and a BS from the University of Delaware, in Mechanical Engineering."

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"5775888a51ac841458f842bf"	"3 Best Mobile Battery Saver Apps - #WhatTheApp"	"youtube.com"	"UPDATE yourself with the newest technology.

A radically new approach to the design of batteries, developed by researchers at MIT, could provide a lightweight and inexpensive alternative to existing batteries for electric vehicles and the power grid. The technology could even make ""refueling"" such batteries as quick and easy as pumping gas into a conventional car. The new design should make it possible to reduce the size and the cost of a complete battery system, including all of its structural support and connectors, to about half the current levels. That dramatic reduction could be the key to making electric vehicles fully competitive with conventional gas- or diesel-powered vehicles, the researchers say.
