Though dating and masturbating have long been commandeered by the web, it's only been as a kind of middleman. Now we're nearing the possibility of falling in love with your computer, as meeting your dream partner could be as easy as slipping on Oculus Rift--the most advanced virtual reality headset in the world. In Digital Love, VICE investigates how love and sex is faring in the digital age, starting with technology's notorious bedmate, the adult entertainment industry. We make a pilgrimage to LA's ""Porn Valley"" to witness firsthand how virtual reality is scarily close to creating fully interactive porn before heading to Europe's sex capital, Amsterdam, where the Dutch enthusiastically enlist the use of ""teledildonics"" to enhance their long-distance relationships. Along the way we pick apart the digital world's grip on today's relationships. Apps and the rise of social media have revolutionized dating, while virtual affairs end real-life romances and online role-playing games have gone X-rated. Finally, we takes a look at a very modern taboo and ask: Can man's relationship with machine ever translate into real-life intimacy?

A sex robot that uses Oculus Rift virtual reality display has been unveiled at the Oculus Game Jam in Tokyo. Ressentiment's invention connects a haptic controller called the Novint Falcon to an industrial vibrator made by Tenga. The user dons the Oculus Rift headworn virtual reality display to view sex acts simulated by the Oculus and performed by the Falcon and Tenga. Separately, Oculus Rift is just a head-mounted 3D viewer that makes video games even cooler. Tenga is cylindrical vacuum pump that helps men beat off. The Novint Falcon is device that jitters and shakes to simulate things like shooting guns for video games. By combining their powers, Ressentiment has created a Voltron-like sex robot that will change history! It would seem that it's only a matter of time before Ressentiment's invention hits the market. We have a pretty good idea as to what will happen then: ASDOFACNSLDFAJLJSNDLKJHFEIUH!!! With men no longer motivated to impress the ladies, civilization as we know it will collapse. Say goodbye to sports cars, phallic skyscrapers and ladies' nights. Japan will become the world's largest economy despite an exponentially increasing demographic trough. With men out of the picture and women finally in charge, a wolf will reside with a lamb, and a leopard will lie down with a young goat; an ox and a young lion will graze together, as a small child leads them along, and Israel will sign peace agreements with Iran and Palestine. Or God may just decide to send in the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse a bit early. -------------------------------------------------------- TomoNews is your daily source for top animated news.

Now its possible to create what you think. Its easy to convert your imagination into designs. Easier to explore the places never actually being there. According to Microsoft ""The era of holographic computing is here."" Specially I like this punch line ""When you change the way you see the world,you can change the world you see."" They say that Transform your world with holograms. HoloLens envisioned a world where technology could become more personal--where it could adapt to the natural ways we communicate, learn, and create. Where our digital lives would seamlessly connect with real life. The result is the world's most advanced holographic computing platform, enabled by Windows 10. For the first time ever, Microsoft HoloLens brings high-definition holograms to life in your world, where they integrate with your physical places, spaces, and things. Holograms will improve the way you do things every day, and enable you to do things you've never done before. Microsoft HoloLens puts you at the center of a world that blends holograms with reality. With the ability to design and shape holograms, you'll have a new medium to express your creativity, a more efficient way to teach and learn, and a more effective way to visualize your work and share ideas. Your digital content and creations will be more relevant when they come to life in the world around you. As holograms, your digital content will be as real as physical objects in the room. For the first time, holograms will become practical tools of daily life. Shape holograms to fine-tune a design. Interact with them to learn something new. When you share your ideas, show and tell from multiple perspectives. Microsoft HoloLens enables you to make decisions more confidently, work more effectively, and bring your ideas to life right before your eyes. Microsoft HoloLens goes beyond augmented reality and virtual reality by enabling you to interact with three-dimensional holograms blended with your real world. Microsoft HoloLens is more than a simple heads-up display, and its transparency means you never lose sight of the world around you. High-definition holograms integrated with your real world will unlock all-new ways to create, communicate, work, and play. There isn't a screen to touch or a mouse to click. Use gestures to create, shape, and size holograms. Use your eyes to navigate and explore. Use your voice to communicate with your apps. Microsoft HoloLens understands your movements, vision, and voice, enabling you to interact with content and information in the most natural way possible."

"5758f5a051ac842193363b7a"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016"	"youtube.com"	"Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 Google is expected to dive deeper into virtual reality and artificial intelligence Wednesday during an annual conference that serves as a launching pad for its latest products and innovations. Although Google keeps its plans under wraps until the big event, the conference agenda makes it clear that virtual reality and artificial intelligence, or ""machine learning,"" will be among the focal points. That has spurred speculation that Google is getting ready to release a virtual-reality device to compete with Facebook's new Oculus Rift headset, as well as the Samsung's Gear VR and the Vive from HTC and Valve. Reporters and bloggers from around the world will attend, ensuring that whatever the company unveils will also be featured in stories, pictures and video delivered to a vast audience of consumers. The three-day showcase also attracts thousands of computer programmers, giving Google an opportunity to convince them why they should design applications and other services that work with its gadgets and an array of software that includes the Chrome Web browser and Android operating system for mobile devices. Android powers about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, largely because Google gives away the software for free to device makers. Google can afford to do that because it designs Android to feature its search engine, maps and other digital services, giving it more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. But Apple's iPhone carries more cachet with affluent consumers and often introduces features that Android copies. Apple will hold a similar conference in June to unveil its fall software plans. Google is holding this year's conference, called Google I/O, at an amphitheater a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters. With more than 6,000 seats, the amphitheater could potentially accommodate a larger crowd than the San Francisco venue where Google held I/O in past years. Google's bare-bones entry into the still-nascent field of virtual reality came two years ago when it unveiled a cheap headset made out of cardboard. The company may now be poised to get more serious, given far more sophisticated options available for sale. Analysts are touting virtual reality, a technology that casts its users into artificial, three-dimensional worlds, as one of the industry's most promising areas for growth. Artificial intelligence, a term used to describe efforts to develop software that acts and behaves more like humans, has been a focal point of Google's for years. Progress in the field has helped Google's search engine comprehend the intent of people's inquiries more quickly and vastly improved the comprehension and responsiveness of its voice-recognition services. Analysts have speculated that Google might tap into its artificial-intelligence research to introduce a virtual-assistant product that could be set up in homes to help people manage their lives and get information more quickly. Such a device would represent Google's response to the growing popularity of Amazon's Echo, a cylinder-like device equipped with speakers and an Internet-connected microphone that enables a virtual assistant called Alexa to interact with its users. ============================================================ Video Link : https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw ========================= My Top 3 Video : ============= 1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OnE6yCIhSw 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFEl5DFaUzI 3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st-iTl4oDdU ========================================= Preview || Expect virtual reality, artificial intelligence from Google || Trending News || May 2016 ==================================================================================================="	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aX_bQFKzGXw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/aX_bQFKzGXw"	"577587d751ac84144a0d0f2b"	"SNIPER FIRE! | The Nest (HTC Vive Virtual Reality)"	"youtube.com"	"I never knew I wanted a Sniping virtual reality game on the HTC Vive until now!!

"5758f92351ac8421ccf54b96"	"Internet of things speech Jeremy Rifkin on future of energy, connectivity & footprint"	"youtube.com"	"This speech of the world-reknown future expert Jeremy Rifkin is huge: At this very event held and of course paid by Daimler/Mercedes, Jeremy Rifkin refers to one of the main reasons of climate change and environmental pollution, even more important than cars: the meat industry. Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

Mobile innovation company SPRXmobile launches Layar, worlds first mobile Augmented Reality browser, which displays real time digital information on top of reality (of) in the camera screen of the mobile phone. While looking through the phones camera lens, a user can see houses for sale, popular bars and shops, jobs, healthcare providers and ATMs. The first country to launch Layar is The Netherlands. Launching partners are local market leaders ING (bank), funda (realty website), Hyves (social network), Tempo-team (temp agency) and Zekur.nl (healthcare provider). How it works Layar is derived from location based services and works on mobile phones that include a camera, GPS and a compass. Layar is first avaliable for handsets with the Android operating system (the G1 and HTC Magic). It works as follows: Starting up the Layar application automatically activates the camera. The embedded GPS automatically knows the location of the phone and the compass determines in which direction the phone is facing. Each partner provides a set of location coordinates with relevant information which forms a digital layer. By tapping the side of the screen the user easily switches between layers. This makes Layar a new type of browser which combines digital and reality, which offers an augmented view of the world. Dutch launch The premier launch is for the Dutch market. Launching content partners are ING (ATMs), Funda (houses for sale), Hyves (social network hot spots) Tempo-team (jobs) and Zekur.nl (healthcare providers). Layar will be launched per country with local content partners in order to guarantee relevent results for the end user. SPRXmobile is planning further roll-outs, together with local partners, in Germany, the UK and the United States this year. SPRXmobile wil continue with regular releases of new layers after each local launch. The Layar application will be available via the Android Market. Other handsets and operating systems are in development with a prime focus on the iPhone 3G S. SPRXmobile Layar is developed by SPRXmobile, a mobile innovation company. Eventually, the physical and the virtual worlds will become one. Many visions on Augmented Reality have already been developed, but we are proud to be able to bring this one step closer to reality, says Raimo van der Klein, co-founder of SPRXmobile.

So here is my slightly more realistic version of Google's augmented reality glasses - now featuring contextual Google Ads! Of course I'm exaggerating a bit here for visual effect to mimic the modern web browsing experience. Google will probably not be this obvious with their interface but there's no question that the company will be gathering a massive amount of extremely personal data based on what you look at and for how long. The company may use this data mining to build even more detailed consumer profiles and/or sell uber targeted ads. Because let's face it, Google is really just a massive advertising company at heart. Fun Fact: All of the AdWords used are actual Google ad returns found via Google searches based on the dialog, situation or setting in the original video. Yes ""Music, Stop!"" does actually return an ad asking if you would like to listen to music. Google really can't be too annoyed at this remix because after all I'm just putting Google Ads overtop of a Google video on Google's owned video hosting service. See the original Google video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4 UPDATE: This remix appears to have gone viral with over half a million views in 5 days. I'm happy the video has been part of the changing media story around Google's ""augmented reality"" product from the initial uncritical view to a slightly more skeptical frame that at least raises concerns about privacy, personal data mining and ""targeted"" advertising. FURTHER READING: Back in February 2012 Sebastian Anthony wrote about the then-rumored Google glasses on Extreme Tech saying  - ""Remember, Google is ultimately an advertising company, where eyeballs directly translate into money -- and it's hard to get any closer to your eyes than a pair of augmented reality glasses. When you look at a car dealership, Google will be able to display ads from a competitor. When you sit in front of a computer, or TV, or stare through a shop window, the glasses will be able to track your head movements and report back on the efficacy of display ads. Perhaps most excitingly, when you read a newspaper or book or other static medium, Google could even overlay its own, interactive ads.""

The phone provides a window into a 3d town overrun with zombies. Point the camera at our special game map to mix virtual and real world content. Civilians are trapped in the town, and must escape before the zombies eat them! From your vantage point in a helicopter overhead, you must shoot the zombies to clear the path for the civilians to get out. Watch out though as the zombies will fight back, throwing bloody organs to bring down your copter. Move the phone quickly to dodge them. You can also use Skittles as tangible inputs to the game, placing one on the board and shooting it to trigger an explosion. One of the inspirations for this game was the game Joe Warpin, from our Handheld Augmented Reality games class (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62cbXp1rO6s ). http://ael.gatech.edu/lab/research/handheld-ar/arhrrrr/ http://www.cc.gatech.edu/ http://www.scad.edu/atlanta/"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNu4CluFOcw/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/cNu4CluFOcw"

However, given the proliferation and popularity of digital devices, real-world activities like coloring can seem unexciting, and children become less engaged in them. Augmented reality holds unique potential to impact this situation by providing a bridge between real-world activities and digital enhancements. In this paper, we present an augmented reality coloring book App in which children color characters in a printed coloring book and inspect their work using a mobile device. The drawing is detected and tracked, and the video stream is augmented with an animated 3-D version of the character that is textured according to the child's coloring. This is possible thanks to several novel technical contributions. We present a texturing process that applies the captured texture from a 2-D colored drawing to both the visible and occluded regions of a 3-D character in real time. We develop a deformable surface tracking method designed for colored drawings that uses a new outlier rejection algorithm for real-time tracking and surface deformation recovery. We present a content creation pipeline to efficiently create the 2-D and 3-D content. And, finally, we validate our work with two user studies that examine the quality of our texturing algorithm and the overall App experience."

Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology defined by its ability to overlay physical space with information. It is part of a paradigm shift that succeeds Virtual Reality; instead of disembodied occupation of virtual worlds, the physical and virtual are seen together as a contiguous, layered and dynamic whole. It may lead to a world where media is indistinguishable from 'reality'. The spatial organisation of data has important implications for architecture, as we re-evaluate the city as an immersive human-computer interface."

AR Games is a game that takes advantage of Augment Reality with the included 6 AR cards that come with the system.  To set the game up you lay down the question block card on the table and stand about 14 inches away from the card to activated it.  One activated you will see a yellow box man pop up out of the card and present you with options. I decided to play the archery game first which has you shooting at targets that you have to move around the card to shoot them. The game takes advantage of the two cameras on the outside and the gyroscope. Very fun game which makes you think of the possibilities down the line of other games that will take advantage of it. The next section we tried was the Star pics which involves the other AR cards.  When you put these cards in front of the  camera the character will come to life in full 3D. You can change the size, position and even the post of the character to get that ultimate Nintendo mash up photo you've always wanted. AR games is a great tech demo of AR technology and I couldn't be more excited about the possibilities of this tech. Imaging a Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh game that takes advantage of this. It would bring those game and gaming in general to the next level."

OutRun offers a unique mixed reality simulation as one physically drives through an 8-bit video game. The windshield of the system features custom software that transforms the real world into an 8-bit video game, enabling the user to have limitless gameplay opportunities while driving. Hertz has designed OutRun to de-simulate the driving component of a video game: where game simulations strive to be increasingly realistic (usually focused on graphics), this system pursues ""real"" driving through the game. Additionally, playing off the game-like experience one can have driving with an automobile navigation system, OutRun explores the consequences of using only a computer model of the world as a navigation tool for driving.

This is an actual game-prototype using techniques and tools from a well-known branch of computer vision called Augmented Reality. Using tilt motions, the player moves a character through rooms that appear inside one of several cubes on a table. Each room is logically connected by a series of doors, though some doors lead nowhere (they are traps). The player has 2 minutes to find the exit of each cube, leading the character into the entrance of the next.. Work is also being done to use invisible markers such that the cube itself appears entirely white to the naked eye.

BMW Self Driving Car From driver to ""Ultimate Driver"" - through digital intelligence. ""Alive Geometry"" enables intuitive driver-vehicle interaction. ""Boost"" and ""Ease"" driving modes enable driver- or vehicle-controlled operation. ""Companion"": The intelligent digital partner connects driver and car. Trademark BMW exterior. BMW Self Driving Car Materials of the future. From driver to Ultimate Driver - BMW Self Driving Car through digital intelligence. In the future, BMW drivers will still want to spend most of the time they are in their car at the wheel. In the BMW VISION NEXT 100 BMW Self Driving Car, the driver will remain firmly in the focus, with constant connectivity, digital intelligence and state-of-the-art technologies available for support. But that's not all: the BMW VISION NEXT 100 will turn the driver into the Ultimate Driver. So even though the world may well be changing, Sheer Driving Pleasure is here to stay - and will be more intense than ever before even in the BMW Self Driving Car. In designing the BMW VISION NEXT 100, the starting point was the interior of the BMW Self Driving Car. In the years ahead, the driver's wellbeing will become increasingly important, and rather than merely feeling they are in a machine that drives itself, they should sense that they are sitting in one that was specifically designed for them. This idea gave rise to an architecture in which the BMW Self Driving Car cab seems particularly spacious compared with the overall size of the vehicle while retaining the typical exterior lines of a BMW. Despite its domed BMW Self Driving Car interior, the BMW VISION NEXT 100 retains the instantly recognisable athletic silhouette of a BMW saloon. The design of the BMW Self Driving Car interior permits various modes of operation: Boost mode, in which the driver is at the controls, and Ease mode, in which the driver can sit back and let the BMW Self Driving Car take over. In Ease, the BMW Self Driving Car becomes a place of retreat with plenty of space, agreeable lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. In Boost, the driver takes over and benefits from the subtle and intuitive support offered by the vehicle. All the time, the BMW Self Driving Car is learning more and more about the person at the wheel, thanks to its sensory and digital intelligence, which the BMW Group calls the Companion. The BMW Self Driving Car Companion progressively learns to offer the right kind of support to transform the driver into the Ultimate Driver. A very important element of the Vision BMW Self Driving Car is another innovation known as Alive Geometry, the likes of which have never before been seen in a car. It consists of a kind of three-dimensional sculpture that works both inside and outside the vehicle. An autonomous car, also known as a driverless car, self-driving car and robotic car, is an automated or autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car. As an autonomous vehicle / Self Driving Car, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems. Self Driving Cars / Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[6][7] By definition, autonomous vehicles are capable of updating their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position. Some demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars, date back to the 1920s and 30s. The first self-sufficient (and therefore, truly autonomous) cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Development of fully autonomous vehicles is well underway 1 in 3 UK motorists would already consider buying an self driving car Bosch can supply all the required components for autonomous vehicles Bosch already provides high-performance assistance systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control and Predictive Emergency Braking System.

It's controlled with an iPhone app that streams real-time video from its onboard camera. Using accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors, and a downward facing camera, the AR Drone automatically stabilizes itself in flight. You use the iPhone to control the AR Drone through on-screen controls or by tilting the iPhone. Needless to say, this is awesome."

With grid-scale energy storage, intermittent sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, become viable for the grid. VLAB will examine the technology and economics to make this transformation possible. The global market for energy storage services could be worth as much as $31.5 billion in 2017, according to Lux Research.  Additionally, Pike Research forecasts that $122 billion will be invested in energy storage projects between 2011 and 2021. Today, 99% of the global energy storage is pumped hydro, which is geographically constrained. Now entrepreneurs free us from this constraint with fundamentally new technology challenging conventional expectations of capacity, efficiency and product life. Where are the best business opportunities for these start-ups -- at green energy farms? on the grid? or at the consumer's home or business? What are key metrics to make this economically viable, without subsidies? Efficiency, life-time costs, Capex? Will advances in traditional pumped hydro and compressed air prevail over battery/chemical technologies? Which countries are leading in Energy Storage on/off the grid? When will these new technologies become profitable? How and when will US utility companies get on-board? Join us to Learn More.

Instead of using heavy metal oxides, lithium-air batteries borrow oxygen from the air as the vehicle is being driven, creating an air-breathing battery.  This results in lighter batteries with high energy density that extend the car's range from a single charge. IBM researchers have successfully demonstrated in the lab the fundamental chemistry of the charge-and-recharge process for lithium-air batteries and, if this bold research project is successful, people could see it in cars between 2020 and 2030."

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

This is very easy to make and puts out quite an amount of small MilliWatts of power. Not just yet to light up an 1.2 Volts 0.22 Amps incandescent bulb, but at least it blinks it. With a well built Joule Thief circuit this should be able to really power up many LEDs very brightly. This will be the next thing I will try. So how is this battery be made the cheapest way ? You just need Aluminiumfoil from the supermarket, a carbonfiber sheet ( This is the only thing you probably have to order, as the other parts you will get very easily) and some ashes from a fireplace. (woodashes or coalashes) or instead of the woodashes you can also get Sodium Carbonate, that is also called Washing  Soda. This is also available is every bigger supermarket. You could also use Sodimpercarbonate from spot removal wshing solution powders , but this is more aggressive and more expensive, so stick with ashes ( it is free) or buy some washing Soda. So then you take about 3 to 4 teaspons of Washing soda or ashes and put it in about 100 MilliLiters of tap water ( about 1/2 drinking glas full of water). Then you use this solution after stirring to put it onto a paper towel and put this wet paper towel between the alufoil and the carbonfiber sheet. Then you have just about 1.4 Volts open circuit voltage  and more than 100 milliamps of short circuit current. (from a size of around DinA4 sized sheets, so around 20 x 30 cm). Now you can stack several cells in series to be able to directly light some LEDs or just use a Joule Thief circuit on ONE cell to light up a few LEDs. I will soon build my own powerful Joule Thief circuit and will show this also then. So stay tuned to my channel and please subscribe, rate and comment and share it with your friends. This is a great battery cell for emergency usage as the only thing that decomposes is the Alufoil ! The carbonfibersheet can be washed off with water and always be reused ! This is the way to go to build selfmade cheap batteries to power LEDs. Hope you enjoyed it.

Especially check Min 45:30 in the video, but it's really worth to watch the whole thing if you want to know how our econmy is going - and has - to change. It really means a lot to me, as when I, as an automotive journalist, raise strong concerns about meat & dairy consumption as well as on the use of leather in cars, a lot of people in and outside the automotive industry react with denial or even think I would be disconnected from reality. So it is even more pleasing that a very important consultant of many top governments raises this issue at an event organised by the automotive industry itself. Well played and thank you, Jeremy Rifkin.

On this week's episode, Jon rants about battery technology. He recalls using his GameBoy as a child and wishing the batteries would last longer. Whenever he'd get to a good part, the game would shut down. Fast forward several years and the battery technology has remained relatively the same. Jon believes poor battery technology is holding back consumer electronics. For example, it has taken years for laptop batteries to improve from 3 hours to 6 hours. On the other hand, mobile processors have gone from single-core to octa-core in less same time. Why isn't battery technology improving faster?

Science Nation YouTube Playlist ^ http://goo.gl/51GTGd Leg Prosthesis With early support from the National Science Foundation and continued support from the National Institutes of Health, Vanderbilt University mechanical engineer Michael Goldfarb has spent several years developing the leg, which operates with special sensors, an electric motor, a battery and computer technology. Artificial Limbs Sensors monitor the user's motion and microprocessors figure out what the person is trying to do. Goldfarb says the powered leg reduces the lag time between a real leg and a prosthetic one.  Hutto confirms that the powered prosthetic is much better at anticipating his next move. Transcript you might say craig hutto is part bionic man in 2005 doctors amputated his leg above the knee after a shark attacked him along the florida gulf coast i was sixteen years old and when my brother heard me yell what was that and saw something take me under he saw the the back fin of the shark i mean it was just so much tissue damage and so much flesh gone that it was just irreparable 2 years later and game for a challenge hutto became the first test pilot for unique and powerful new prosthetic leg developed by mechanical engineer michael goldfarb and his team at vanderbilt university the effort was kick started by a grant from the national science foundation we were able to develop a early prototype that demonstrated that you could have leg that with light enough and could deliver by mechanical levels of torque and power version one dot 0 evolved into a more streamlined two dot 0 computer-controlled with advanced range of motion in the joints this is a battery that powers everything uh... you have a uh... motor here that uh... drives the knee joint motor here that drives the ankle joint this is the whole computer board that essentially tells the motor what to do with the joints it has the computing capability on board to work synergistically with the user to provide the torque at the right time it's designed to responded to cues from the wearer right before i go to stair accent i kind of kick my thigh back just a little bit and just that little movement tells it hey you're about to walk up stairs to reduce the risk of injury goldfarbs team has intentionally programmed a slight delay into the legs computer hutto confirms it takes less effort to walk compared to the prosthetic he wears on a daily basis with my leg it is harder because it's always a step behind me goldfarb says after years of work they have sold their technology to a major prosthetic manufacturer we will know in the next few years if these are going to really gain a lot of traction in the market and hutto who is now studying to be a nurse is looking forward to one day soon walking tall on a bionic leg that he helped make a reality for science nation im miles obrien Post comments or questions, share, like and subscribe!

Among the leading resources of battery drain on a mobile device is the display. Bearing this in your mind, it is vital that you utilize a mobile device's battery as economically as you can. Nothing sucks more than needing to make a call during an emergency and your phone is dead. Battery technology proceeds to enhance, but most batteries still do not have the type of life we had like them to. Snatch another battery and mobile battery charger to your digital camera or camcorder, before you package to get a large excursion and cover your bases. Existing mobile batteries in the marketplace are usually geared for crisis charging."	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9b7eQ493ncE/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/9b7eQ493ncE"

A brief description of the 360V Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery charging procedures for the 2012 Chevrolet Volt Extended Range Vehicle.  This vehicle combines an Electric Vehicle (EV) for trips 25-52 miles in length with a gasoline powered generator (40 mpg+) for trips with no length restrictions. There are several battery charging options available for the Volt: 1. LEVEL 1 CHARGER: The 120V charger that comes with the vehicle, just plug it in to a power socket in your garage; it can take up to 10 hours to charge a fully depleted battery. 1. LEVEL 2 CHARGER: The 208V - 240V charger that you must purchase separately. These chargers must be professionally installed.  There are federal tax credits for the chargers. These chargers can take 4.75 hours on 240V or 4.5 hours on 208V to charge a fully depleted battery. Chevrolet Volt charger options can be found at http://evse.spx.com Be aware that some chargers are only for the Chevrolet Volt (15 Amps) and others support the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1772 standard which will charge many different electric vehicles (15 - 30 Amps) including the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus EV, Toyota Prius PHV and RAV4 EV, Honda Fit EV, Tesla Vehicles, and etc. Be sure to see our two other Chevrolet Volt videos: 1. 2012 Chevrolet Volt Overview 2. 2012 Chevrolet Volt Energy Efficiency We teach advanced vehicle technologies to our automotive students at Weber State University and online.

Don't get excited, this is just a virtual prototype, and will most likely never go into production. However it's important to note that the technology is available to construct such a battery right now. In fact, if you visit the official nano.gov site, you can even find a reference to the very concept employed in this demo. Still not convinced? Check out the links below: Nanoantennas http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoantenna Solar Plastics http://www.nano.gov/html/facts/nanoapplicationsandproducts.html Super Capacitors http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_capacitor Honda's Ultra-capacitor http://world.honda.com/FuelCell/FCX/ultracapacitor/ All that being said.. Keep in mind the first law of thermodynamics: ""Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms."" Always ask yourself before moving forward; will the effect of this phase change on the environment and humanity be positive or negative? In the modern world, the millions of batteries produced every year pose a constant risk to ecological and human health. Nanotechnology is still an extremely nascent field of science. More research needs to be done- a lot more. Products like this simply should not be mass produced until a comprehensive risk assessment is complete. July 21, 2010 Update: Check out this similar concept, only far less advanced & practical, but extra points for an actual physical (and quite attractive) prototype: http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/02/19/batteries-recharged.html"	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x92qqJ5yQnM/mqdefault.jpg"	"jpg"	"https://youtu.be/x92qqJ5yQnM"

But through it all, battery life has mostly stayed the same. Virtually every electronic device today relies on lithium-ion batteries, which provide power by transferring ions between the anode and cathode of a battery cell. The amount of lithium ions inside the battery directly affects how long your device can last on a charge. The problem lies in the graphite that stores lithium ions in the anode of a battery. Graphite has a theoretical limit to how much lithium it can hold, and today's batteries have pretty much reached it. So how can we improve the capacity of today's batteries? The answer is Graphene, a Nobel prize-winning material made from atom-thick layers of graphite. Graphene has a high surface area to mass ratio and it means more space in which to store energy, without increasing the total mass of battery. Graphene is also the most conductive material that can offer 10 times faster charging speed. This means, charging your phone in minutes instead of hours! which will last 4 days straight.

Following this introduction, a short overview of technology associated with lithium ion batteries for traction applications will be provided. Last, I shall present new research results that enable adaptive characterization of lithium ion cells. Experimental and modeling results help to clarify the underlying electrochemistry and system performance. Specifically, through chemical modification of the electrodes, it is possible to place markers within the electrodes that signal the state of charge of a battery through abrupt voltage changes during cell operation, thereby allowing full utilization of the battery in applications. In closing, I shall highlight some promising materials research efforts that are expected to lead to substantially improved battery technology."

Lithium-ion batteries, the power source for many consumer electronic devices, including cell phones, laptops, MP3 players, cameras, and hybrid and electric cars, are often the most unstable electronic component, as they are susceptible to overheating, which can cause fires and explosions. To meet the growing demand for safer lithium batteries, ITRI successfully developed STOBA, which has fundamentally resolved the safety issue. By integrating a nano-grade polymer, which forms a protective film much like a nano-grade fuse, into the Li-ion battery a locking effect is generated when the battery encounters excessive heat, external impact or piercing and interrupts the electrical and chemical action, preventing explosions that threaten consumer safety."
